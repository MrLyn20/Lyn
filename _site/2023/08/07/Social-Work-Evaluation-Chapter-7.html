<h1>Chapter 7 Crafting Goals and Objectives</h1>

<p class="view">by JAMES R. DUDLEY</p>

<h1 id="chapter-7-crafting-goals-and-objectives">CHAPTER 7 Crafting Goals and Objectives</h1>

<p><em>The ultimate questions of importance are, what is the intervention supposed to accomplish, and is it adequately measured?</em></p>

<p>Frequently, planning a new program or practice intervention involves preparing a grant proposal for funding, and this proposal can be an important exercise for describing what the intervention is supposed to look like. A proposal includes many elements of relevance to an evaluation, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Program goals and objectives;</li>
  <li>Interventions for helping clients reach goals;</li>
  <li>A budget; and</li>
  <li>An evaluation plan to determine whether the program is effective.</li>
</ul>

<p>An evaluation plan, the last component mentioned, is typically required in virtually all grant proposals. Unfortunately, such a plan is often largely incidental to the program construction process of many proposals. What often happens is that it tends to be an add-on prepared by someone in tune with research methods who is not directly involved in the construction of the program; the primary motivation for preparing the evaluation plan is to satisfy the funding agency.</p>

<p>In any event, evaluation considerations are extremely important to think about and plan for while a program is in the development stage. The logic model helps explain why. As described in Chapter 6, the logic model recommends that the input, implementation, output, and outcome elements be logically connected. These stages and their respective elements need to be carefully thought out in relation to one another, and this all needs to begin in the planning stage. This chapter examines two critical components of program and practice interventions: goals and objectives. Goals and measurable objectives are crafted during the planning or input stage when a program or practice intervention is under construction. Goals and objectives pro- vide a central anchor or reference point for conducting most evaluations.</p>

<p>The goals and objectives of a new intervention need focused attention. Some pertinent questions are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the goals of the intervention?</li>
  <li>What are the measurable objectives crafted for each of these goals?</li>
  <li>Are the goals and objectives logically linked to clients’ problems, unmet needs, and the underlying causes?</li>
  <li>Is there a logical link between the goals and objectives and how the intervention is implemented to reach these goals?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Helping an Agency Develop a New Program with an Evaluation Infrastructure</strong></p>

  <p>A graduate student devised the following set of questions to guide her as she helped her agency incorporate an evaluation component into a new proposed program.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What is the problem that you want to solve or tackle? What do you believe are the causes of this problem?</li>
    <li>Who are the people experiencing this problem that you want to help?</li>
    <li>What are your overall goals for solving this problem? How long will it take to reach each goal?</li>
    <li>What intervention strategy do you plan to use to meet your goals? Describe your intervention plan. How will it contribute to meeting the goals?</li>
    <li>Identify the specific indicators (measurable objectives) that will tell you that you have reached your goals. List as many as possible.</li>
    <li>What resources do you have that will help you conduct an evaluation?</li>
    <li>What constraints may hinder you in conducting an evaluation?</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="goals-for-program-and-practice-interventions">GOALS FOR PROGRAM AND PRACTICE INTERVENTIONS</h2>

<p>Every program and practice intervention should have a set of goals that provide direction and an end-result for clients to pursue. Basic questions to ask about goals are the following: Where is this program/practice intervention headed? What do we want to accomplish as goals? How feasible is it to have success in achieving these goals? What approaches are known to work in helping clients reach these goals?</p>

<p>Although having goals is something that every intervention should have, most staff members and some agency administrators may not be well versed about them. This can result in the interventions spinning their wheels, going in unproductive directions, and wasting valuable resources. In other instances, agency interventions may have goals, but goals that are too vague to provide any direction or benchmarks for measuring progress. Examples of some vague goals chosen to help clients are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Becoming more independent.</li>
  <li>Resolving conflicts in a parent-child relationship.</li>
  <li>Becoming an empowered family.</li>
  <li>Being discharged from the hospital.</li>
  <li>Increasing positive social behaviors.</li>
  <li>Reducing antisocial behaviors.</li>
  <li>Improving performance in school.</li>
  <li>Successfully working in a competitive job.</li>
  <li>Keeping the youth safe.</li>
  <li>Alleviating crises.</li>
  <li>Reuniting a client with her or his family.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-of-a-frequently-ignored-program-goal">Example of a Frequently Ignored Program Goal</h3>

<p>During the past several decades, sheltered workshops have been considered an essential type of vocational program in the array of program offerings available   for people with mental retardation. This has been the case in both community- based and institutional systems.  A major goal for most sheltered workshops is to prepare people for the competitive workforce. Sheltered workshops are protected work sites for people with disabilities that employ them in assembling consumer goods like the airplane headsets used for watching movies or small hardware items like small bolts sealed in a plastic bag and sold in hard-ware stores. Yet these programs are often actually driven by two implicit goals that are in direct tension with the major goal. The implicit goals are to find work contracts of any kind to occupy the clients in the workshops and to provide a     safe environment for them during the daytime hours. Because the implicit goals are important, sheltered workshops seldom succeed in accomplishing the major goal of preparing participants for competitive employment (e.g., Dudley &amp; Schatz, 1985).</p>

<h2 id="characteristics-of-goals">CHARACTERISTICS OF GOALS</h2>

<p>Measurable goals are critical to any successful program or individual practice intervention. They are important because they provide an intervention with a direction to pursue and an outcome to reach. Without goals, an intervention could be an aimless effort that does not seem to go anywhere important. Goals have many other characteristics that are important to understand. Some of them are elaborated on next.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Goals focus on all system levels.</li>
  <li>Goals also focus on all prevention levels.</li>
  <li>Goals are oriented to a time-period.</li>
  <li>They are expected to be relevant to the intervention to which they are linked.</li>
  <li>They should be responsive to the needs of the clients whom they serve.</li>
  <li>They can be one dimensional or be considered in combination with other related goals.</li>
  <li>Some goals focus on the processes of programs and practice interventions while others focus on client outcomes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="all-system-levels">All System Levels</h3>

<p>The goals of social workers are evident at all system levels, including the work with individuals, families, groups, communities, organizations, and policies. Most social workers emphasize the micro (individuals) and mezzo (families and groups) levels of intervention because that is where the greatest demand is. Goals at macro levels such as working with communities, organizations, and policy also are very important in impacting societal change and social justice; much more emphasis could be given to these types of goals.</p>

<h3 id="all-prevention-levels">All Prevention Levels</h3>

<p>Goals are also evident at all levels of prevention: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary and secondary level goals are preferred to tertiary prevention because problems that can be avoided or headed off at an early stage will bring less harm and cost less to achieve. Yet most programs and practice interventions that governmental agencies fund focus on tertiary issues or treatment. Treatment interventions usually provide help once a problem is fully evident and has obvious adverse effects on clients’ lives. Unfortunately, government agencies tend to be unwilling to invest in funding or sponsoring interventions until clients reach this tertiary stage.</p>

<h3 id="time-oriented">Time-Oriented</h3>

<p>Goals are oriented to a time period, for the short run, mid-range run, or long run. Short-term goals can be helpful as stepping stones to mid-range goals, and mid- range goals are intended to lead to long-term ones. Although short-term goals are important, long-term goals are ultimately most important because they reflect the outcomes expected of successfully functioning people. For example, a short-term goal for a client with an addiction problem may be to no longer desire drugs while attending a drug treatment program, a mid-range goal may be to live drug free in a halfway house for six months, and the long-term goal may be total withdrawal from drug use and drug culture. Similarly, a short-term goal for an ex-offender may be to stay out of trouble and regularly report on his or her activities to a probation officer during the probation period, while the long-term goal is to discontinue committing crimes altogether. Later in the book, we will discuss how agency evaluations tend to give primary emphasis to short-term goals and overlook the mid-range and long-term ones.</p>

<h3 id="linked-to-the-intervention">Linked to the Intervention</h3>

<p>The goals of an intervention should be a logical outgrowth of the intervention. After having a reasonably thorough description of the intervention, one should have a good grasp of what it intends to accomplish. The goals of the program should logic- ally and realistically reflect this. For example, if a program involves counseling, its goals are likely to reflect some form of personal or interpersonal improvement in the client, whereas a program designed to refer clients to other agencies is likely to have goals related to connecting clients with the referral agencies and using their services.</p>

<h3 id="responsive-to-the-clients-needs">Responsive to the Clients’ Needs</h3>

<p>Our goals should be responsive to what our clients need. Advocacy provides one example. Social workers are expected to have advocacy as a frequently identified goal with their clients. We want our interventions to make a difference in our clients’ lives and prefer to involve them to the greatest extent possible in the decisions that will help that to happen. Not only should program and practice goals be responsive to client needs, but the clients’ evaluations should be as well. A bold way to increase client participation and advocacy is to involve them in their evaluations as they progress. The participatory action approach, described in Chapter 2, offers one way to do this.</p>

<h3 id="interrelated-with-other-goals">Interrelated with Other Goals</h3>

<p>Programs and practice interventions can have one central goal or several interrelated ones. It often depends on what the problem is, what policies are being addressed, the expectations of the agency provider, and the resources available. Interrelated goals are important because some goals cannot be effectively addressed without considering their interdependence with other goals. For example, a welfare reform program may emphasize one goal: clients’ obtaining a job. Or the program could be more comprehensive, giving equal emphasis to two or three interrelated goals, such as obtaining a decent-paying job, securing day care for the client’s children, and securing a safe home for the family. A program that has a set of interrelated goals often tends to be more effective in helping clients than one with a single goal.</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-either-processes-of-interventions-or-client-outcomes">Focus on Either Processes of Interventions or Client Outcomes</h3>

<p>Goals can focus on any number of things, including clients, staff members, and others. Linfield and Posavac (2019) identify three types of goals: setting up a program, implementing a program, and determining whether the program is successful in helping the clients meet their goals or outcomes. All three types of goals are interdependent. Outcome goals for clients are the ultimate reason for having a program. However, outcome goals depend on prior success with planning goals and implementation goals.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of Types of Goals</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Planning goals</strong>: Goals that are involved in setting up a program (e.g., locating a satellite facility site for the program, hiring a team of five clinical supervisors). These goals are carried out by service providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate or implementation goals</strong>: Goals involved in executing or carrying out the program (e.g., admitting twenty-five qualified clients, providing weekly supervision of each direct-care worker). These goals are also carried out by service providers.</li>
    <li><strong>Outcome goals</strong>: Goals for clients to achieve as they complete the program (e.g., learn communication skills that help express anger verbally). Outcome goals are primarily carried out by clients. (Linfield &amp; Posavac, 2019)</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="limitations-of-goals">LIMITATIONS OF GOALS</h2>

<p>Most efforts to craft goals for interventions have challenges that should be noted. These challenges overlap in some ways. They include not always being easy to measure, they can be too theoretical or global, and they can be unobservable. Also, some goals are only discovered after a program has been implemented.</p>

<h3 id="not-easy-to-measure">Not Easy to Measure</h3>

<p>Many goals do not easily convert into measurable forms without losing some of their properties or meaning. A severe case of anxiety, for example, is a complex psychiatric condition to diagnose and measure. This is particularly the case when overcoming anxiety becomes a goal of a clinical program. In this instance, we often want to know not just whether the client has an anxiety disorder but also the severity of the anx- iety and what constitutes improvement or decline. In practice, changes in a severe anxiety disorder can be most easily detected by a clinical social worker who uses qualitative questions individualized to a specific client’s sources of anxiety and other circumstances. Obtaining a standardized quantitative measure of improvement in an anxiety disorder appears to be more challenging. However, existing standardized scales with established properties of validity and reliability may be another way to measure whether such a goal has been reached, even though the scales may miss some subtle but important properties of this psychiatric condition.</p>

<p>Other goals may be easy to convert into measurable forms but difficult to measure practically. In this case, methodologies are sometimes lacking for obtaining valid data, such as when reliance depends on a client’s self-reporting. Many types of behaviors that are considered personal and private can be intentionally distorted. Clients typically underreport alcohol and drug consumption. Reporting of abuse by perpetrators and victims is also challenging to measure, as is accurate disclosure of safe sexual practices like condom use and number of sexual partners.</p>

<h3 id="too-theoretical">Too Theoretical</h3>

<p>Many program and practice interventions are constructed from an abstract model that begins with theoretical notions of goals. Such theoretical goals can be difficult to measure empirically. For example, many mentoring programs for young African American teenage males offer a surrogate father for a parent who is missing or unavailable in the biological family. These programs typically choose outcome goals for the teenagers such as developing a healthy male identity, preparing to become an active father, and contributing to the well-being of the African American community. Although several overt indicators of the theoretical notions may come to mind, measuring them as they were intended in their theoretical form becomes more challenging.</p>

<h3 id="too-global">Too Global</h3>

<p>Other goals of interventions begin as global outcomes that are expected in the larger community or society, such as reducing the number of homicides or drug trafficking. One small program may be able to address these larger social problems in very limited terms, but many other causal factors beyond the reach of the program are difficult to influence. In other words, a global goal may be very difficult to link to one small program focused on a relatively small number of people and their immediate social circumstances.</p>

<p>An example of a global goal for a community program is reducing the number of divorces in a community of 75,000 people. The community group, First Things First, in Gastonia, North Carolina, established a premarital counseling program for couples sponsored by local churches, synagogues, and mosques. The hope was that the program would have an impact, however small, on the divorce rate. However, they needed help in considering less global goals, such as the participants in their program staying together, particularly during the challenging years of early marriage. Reducing the number of divorces in their community, while relevant and noble, is something that the group had to admit was much bigger than anything it could tackle on its own. The group came to realize that the divorce rate has multiple causes, many of which were beyond its influence and ability to change.</p>

<h3 id="unobservable">Unobservable</h3>

<p>Many goals that are important for programs to influence are internal aspects of human functioning, including people’s attitudes toward themselves and others, their feelings, and their cognitive mental processes. Take racial attitudes, for example. A program may be set up to improve its members’ attitudes toward one another in a culturally diverse community. Such a community could have, for example, African American, Latino, and white members who have lived there for several years, along with recent immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and Iran. In this case, positive racial and ethnic attitudes could be a crucial ingredient in helping such a community function well. Racial attitudes have been measured numerous times in the past, primarily using surveys. Yet we know that such surveys have many
limitations: they often do not elicit totally honest reporting of attitudes, particularly deep-seated attitudes that are difficult for a person to express when faced with self-perceived racial conflicts or threats. A challenge for such programs is to find accurate, in-depth ways to uncover these deeply seated and distorted thought processes and how they can change over time.</p>

<h3 id="unintended-goals">Unintended Goals</h3>

<p>Without question, it is essential to identify the goals of a program during the planning stage. This often takes place as part of a larger effort to describe the purpose of a program and the expected outcomes. Nevertheless, unanticipated or unintended goals can also emerge once a program is implemented and may become as important as the initial goals. When this occurs, which can be often, it is recommended that the new goals, if relevant, be added to the existing ones but not replace them. In this case, measurable objectives should be quickly crafted for them and evaluation data collected as part of an overall evaluation plan.</p>

<p>Identifying unintended goals during program implementation is helpful. Program providers can then address them by adding a new program component or giving new emphasis to collaboration and referrals to other agencies. For example, adding a special referral component to a program is important if an unanticipated client problem is identified that is related to the existing goals but falls outside of the program’s focus and resources.</p>

<p>Unanticipated goals can easily emerge as staff members become more familiar with their clients and their needs. For example, conversations with some teen parents in a family-planning program revealed that some teen mothers viewed pregnancy as a “prize” if the father was popular or a well-known athlete (Dudley, Herring, Cradle, &amp; Rose, 2012). This was considered a prize regardless of whether they were dating him. Such a discovery by a program could result in expanding its attention to this faulty teen viewpoint and to the importance of the father’s responsibilities; it could also result in the program targeting such popular guys for counseling and education.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-measurable-objectives">CRAFTING MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES</h2>

<p>As indicated at the beginning of the chapter, every intervention should have a set of goals to provide it with direction and an end-result. A second principle naturally follows this one: goals should be accompanied by specific measures or indicators that can inform whether they are being reached. These specific indicators are called measurable objectives. Mager (1997) describes a concise and entertaining way to learn how to develop measurable objectives within educational settings; his writings are primarily concerned with measuring students’ performance in the classroom. With some modifications, Mager’s conceptual material has been applied by the author to evaluations in the human services.</p>

<h3 id="defining-measurable-objectives">Defining Measurable Objectives</h3>

<p>Measurable objectives are statements that identify indicators of whether a goal is reached by one client or a set of clients. Let’s first look at measurable objectives for clients at the practice intervention level. Typically, each goal has several measurable objectives, as each objective may reflect only one aspect of the broader goal.</p>

<p>A social worker developing measurable objectives should begin by selecting a specific time in the future (e.g., two weeks, six months) and imagining what progress would be expected of a client at that time and how it will be manifested in measurable objective terms. For example, the social worker might determine that the goal is to improve a client’s parenting skills. In this case, the goal can be that the client will have improved parenting skills with her child six months from now. Next, the social worker and client can think of several indicators of improved parenting skills that the client is hoped to have six months in the future. They may come up with such examples as verbally (instead of physically) expressing anger toward the child nine out of ten times and setting a time limit when permitting the child to go out to play.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A Goal and Five Measurable Objectives for Mr. Lopez</strong></p>

  <p><em>Goal</em>: Mr. Lopez, a frail elderly adult, will remain as independent as possible in a minimally supervised living facility in his community.</p>

  <p><em>Measurable objectives</em>: In eight months, Mr. Lopez will be able to</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wash his own clothes once a week.</li>
    <li>Attend all his meals in the dining hall.</li>
    <li>After reminders, take his required medications in the morning, at noon, and before retiring.</li>
    <li>Attend one or more social events offered by the facility each week.</li>
    <li>Attend the religious services of his church in the community at least twice a month if a volunteer is available to drive him to the church.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see in the example of Mr. Lopez, the goal to remain as independent as possible is rather vague and impossible to accurately measure solely by itself. In this case, Mr. Lopez is living in a minimally supervised living facility and must remain fairly independent to avoid placement in a living facility for more dependent older adults. Remaining independent would mean different things to different people, so this goal needs specificity that is most relevant to Mr. Lopez’s functioning at the facility. As the five measurable objectives indicate, independence for Mr. Lopez refers mostly to taking care of his clothes, eating in a dining hall, taking his medications, having some social contact, and participating in the religious life of his church.</p>

<h3 id="dont-overlook-macro-goals">Don’t Overlook Macro Goals</h3>

<p>Goals can focus on larger systems and macro practice as well as individuals and families. Two goals that focus on the impact of community-level interventions are described next. The first focuses on cleaning up a neighborhood and the second attempts to promote better cross-cultural relationships. Each of these goals has three measurable objectives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Goal</em>: Neighborhood volunteers will improve the appearance of a neighborhood.</p>

  <p><em>Measurable objectives:</em> Neighborhood volunteers will clean at least twelve empty lots.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Neighborhood volunteers will remove at least twenty-five abandoned cars from the neighborhood within six months.</li>
    <li>Ten neighborhood volunteers will sweep targeted areas of the neighbor- hood on one Saturday morning in February.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><em>Goal</em>: Southeast Asian and African American neighbors will improve their relationships with each other in the Monroe neighborhood.</p>

  <p><em>Measurable objectives:</em></p>

  <ol>
    <li>The Monroe neighborhood will increase the number of requests for the Human Relations Council to become involved in resolving neighborhood conflicts from January to April.</li>
    <li>The Monroe neighborhood will decrease the number of police calls resulting from neighborhood conflicts from January to April.</li>
    <li>After electing co-leaders (one African American and the other Southeast Asian) from the neighborhood to plan a block party, the Monroe neighborhood will sponsor (gather) neighbors to attend the block party on a Saturday with at least one fourth of the people attending being from each of the two racial groups.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing measurable objectives is known as “crafting.” Crafting suggests that this task is as much an art as a science. Essentially, there is not one perfect way to craft object- ives. Each set of measurable objectives crafted for a goal can be uniquely applied to a specific individual or group of clients. Ideally, objectives are formulated after extensive discussion between the social worker and the client about what the client wants to achieve and what seems realistic. The worker is primarily a guide in helping clients articulate what makes sense to them and, at times, suggesting various ways to state the objective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of Measurable Client Objectives in a Palliative Care Facility</strong></p>

  <p>Needham and Newbury (2004) conducted a study in a hospice agency of measurable objectives crafted by the patients, caregivers, and staff members as part of a clinical audit. They referred to them as “explicit goals.” Over six months, 79 percent of the patients set measurable objectives, along with 63 percent of the caregivers and 98 percent of the admissions staff. Examples of the patients’ measurable objectives include being able to eat properly, being able to get out of bed, being able to stay well, and not having to take drugs. Of the ninety-seven patients who set measurable objectives, one third were completed entirely by the patients and two thirds required assistance from staff members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do you think about the four measurable objectives identified as examples of the patients in the previous box? Are each of them specific enough to be observable? If not, what would you add or change?</p>

<h3 id="objectives-are-usually-for-clients-not-staff-members">Objectives are Usually for Clients, Not Staff Members</h3>

<p>Sometimes students and others mistakenly use the term <em>measurable objective</em> to measure outcomes for service providers, such as “The social worker will provide a psychoeducational group service of ten sessions for clients” or “The social worker will help the client find a job.” These are examples of measurable objectives that focus on staff interventions instead of client actions. The problem with this is that both the clients’ goals and measurable objectives should ultimately depend on the actions of the clients, not the staff members. Staff members will likely have activities to carry out in assisting the clients with these objectives but these activities should not replace the clients’ actions in importance.</p>

<p>Let’s return to the example of Mr. Lopez, the frail elderly adult mentioned earlier who wanted to remain as independent as he could in a minimally supervised com- munity facility. His goal was to remain as independent as he could and the measurable objectives or indicators that he had reached his goal included washing his own clothes once a week, attending all his meals in the dining hall, and attending the religious services of his church in the community. All these are measurable objectives that involve Mr. Lopez as the subject. Mr. Lopez would have to do these things himself if he was to meet his goal of remaining independent.</p>

<p>It is true that staff assistance is often necessary before clients can do their part. For example, Mr. Lopez could not wash his clothes unless a washing machine and dryer were available to him and possibly a staff member would need to teach him how to use these machines. Likewise, Mr. Lopez would not be able to attend meals in the dining hall if the dining hall was not physically accessible or if he needed a walker to get there and none was available. Similarly, attending religious services was ultimately up to Mr. Lopez to do. He would have to get up on time, bathe and dress himself, and be ready for a ride to the church, but he would also need a volunteer from his church to provide him with the ride.</p>

<p>Some principles to remember in correctly crafting measurable objectives for clients are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Both goals and measurable objectives of clients involve the client as the subject who is to carry out the activity.</li>
  <li>The only difference between goals and objectives is that goals are general and cannot be measured; measurable objectives are specific and are, as indicated, measurable.</li>
  <li>While activities of staff members are sometimes needed, they are not the recipients of services; they are only there in an assistance role to the clients.</li>
  <li>It is true that if the staff members do not fulfill their obligations, clients may not be able to fulfill theirs. In this case, it would become a staff problem that needs to be addressed, not a client problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="three-properties-performance-conditions-and-criteria">THREE PROPERTIES: PERFORMANCE, CONDITIONS, AND CRITERIA</h2>

<p>Measurable objectives have three properties (Mager, 1997): performance, conditions, and criteria. A performance is always necessary to have in an objective, while conditions and criteria are often helpful but not required. Usually, conditions and criteria provide details that are helpful in understanding the objective. Definitions of the three properties are as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><em>Performance</em>: what a person is expected to do</li>
    <li><em>Conditions</em>: prior circumstances or conditions needed before performance can be expected</li>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>A performance is an action that a client is expected to take. The performance is required in every measurable objective because it describes the action that is needed to reach the outcome that is sought. It should be an overt, observable action word, rather than an abstract or covert word.</p>

<p>For an exercise, attempt to identify the words in the following list that are observable or overt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write</li>
  <li>Count</li>
  <li>Understand</li>
  <li>Ask</li>
  <li>Accept</li>
  <li>Attend</li>
</ul>

<p>You were correct if you selected <em>write, count, ask</em>, and <em>attend</em> because each is an overt “action” word that you can observe. Any of these words could be selected as the performance in a measurable objective because they can be observed as happening or not. In contrast, the word <em>understand</em> is not overt or readily measurable. How do we know when our client understands something? Usually we must ask a question and the answer can reveal their understanding. We could replace the word <em>understand</em> with <em>correctly answer</em> as the performance. In this case, we would be able to either hear the response or observe on a questionnaire whether the client gives the correct answer. <em>Accept</em> is another abstract word that social workers often use, and while it is an important term for social work, it can be easily misunderstood because it can mean different things to different people. Can you come up with another word that is like <em>accept</em> but overt or observable?</p>

<p>Sometimes, a performance needs an <em>overt indicator</em>, a word or phrase that is added after a performance to help make it more observable. For example, “comply with instructions” is the performance in the measurable objective “The child will comply with instructions given by her mother.” This performance may not be clear to some people, so an overt indicator can help. In this example, adding the overt indicator “follow them” helps. The objective can now read “The child will comply with instructions (follow them) given by her mother.”</p>

<p>“Provide documentation” is another example of a performance needing an overt indicator, for example in the objective “The client will provide documentation of his citizenship (show his social security card) to receive food stamps.” In this case, “show his social security card” is the overt indicator that indicates the documentation that he will provide.</p>

<h3 id="condition">Condition</h3>

<p>A condition is the second important factor to consider in crafting measurable objectives. A condition refers to a prior observable circumstance that takes place before a performance can occur. Conditions often begin with words such as if, after, as, during, when, while, with, or unless. For example, a measurable objective for a student enrolled in an evaluation course could be “After identifying an agency’s program goal, a student will write three objectives that will measure whether the goal has been reached.” In this example, the condition that needs to occur before a performance is expected is “after identifying an agency’s program goal.” Now let’s go further with this measurable objective. What is the performance? You are correct if you decide the performance is “write.” When you think about it, it makes sense that a goal must be identified before you can write objectives for it. You might also say that the performance is “write three objectives.” However, the word <em>three</em> is more appropriately referred to as a criterion for the performance. You would be most correct to say that the performance is “write” or “write objectives” and “three” (a criterion) are expected.</p>

<p>Sometimes conditions are located in a measurable objective statement after rather than before the performance. For example, in the measurable objective “The client will say ‘please’ when asking for anything to be passed to him while eating dinner,” can you identify the condition in this case? The performance?</p>

<p>You are correct if you identified the condition as “when asking for anything to be passed to him.” Another condition is “while eating dinner.” Both conditions make sense with this objective, as it would not make much sense for the client to say “please” without asking for something to be passed or if he is not eating.</p>

<h3 id="criteria">Criteria</h3>

<p>The third property often included in a measurable objective is criteria. Like conditions, criteria are not required in an objective but usually can add helpful details to define the objective. A criterion is a standard of acceptable performance and is sometimes referred to as a quality that is expected in the performance. For example, an objective may be crafted for a client such as, “The client will attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.” A criterion can be added to this objective to give it more detail and clarity: “The client will attend AA meetings weekly for twelve months.” In this example, the criterion “weekly for twelve months” is added to the expanded version of the objective.</p>

<p>Criteria can describe any of the following qualities of the performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Duration (e.g., six months)</li>
  <li>Frequency (e.g., five job interviews)</li>
  <li>Repetition (e.g., eight of ten times)</li>
  <li>Degree of accuracy or progress (e.g., 70 percent or more correct answers)</li>
  <li>Speed (e.g., complete the assignment in ten minutes)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise: Performance, Condition, and Criteria</strong></p>

  <p>The following goal with three measurable objectives was crafted for several clients receiving services in a mental health outpatient program. Can you identify the performance, condition, and criteria in each of the three measurable objectives? (The answers are in the Resource website?.)</p>

  <p><em>Goal</em>: Clients will increase compliance with medication appointments.</p>

  <p><em>Objective A</em>: If clients wish to remember the dates and times of medication appointments, they will write the time of their next appointment on a calendar.</p>

  <p><em>Objective B</em>: If transportation is needed to appointments, clients will call to arrange for it at least two days prior to the appointment.</p>

  <p><em>Objective C</em>: If clients are ill or otherwise cannot come to their medication appointment, they will call and reschedule their appointment more than twenty-four hours before the missed appointment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the chapter has now covered how to craft goals and measurable objectives, it has not considered how to involve stakeholders in doing this. Martin and Kettner (2009) offer a simple three-step approach as one possible way to involve stakeholders:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> A focus group representing the stakeholders is convened and informed about the most recent, widely accepted research and conceptual frameworks, theories, evaluations, and practice experiences pertinent to a proposed program. In addition, the social problem to be addressed by the program and assumptions about this social problem are made explicit and discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The focus group is asked to identify, discuss, and consider as many goals and measurable objectives for the proposed program as it can.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The group arrives at a consensus on the best goals and measurable objectives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Exercise: Involving Clients in Crafting Measurable Objectives</strong></p>

  <p>Create a fictitious client with a presenting problem and role-play a social worker and the client exchanging ideas about what to do about this problem. After the problem has been identified and thoroughly assessed, have the social worker help the client identify a goal and two measurable objectives in the client’s own words. The worker’s role is to ask questions that will help the client identify his or her goal and measurable objectives in his or her own words. Some helpful questions to consider asking the client are:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>What will it look like when you have reached your goal?</li>
    <li>How will you know that the goal has been reached?</li>
    <li>What will you be able to do or what will you be able to see when you have reached your goal?</li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Exercise: Properties of a Measurable Objectives</strong></p>

  <p>Identify the performance, conditions, and criteria in each of the following measurable objectives crafted for survivors of domestic violence (Fenske, 2006). (Answers are in Resource website?.)</p>

  <p><em>Goal</em>: Clients will decrease their depressive symptoms.</p>

  <p><em>Measurable Objective A</em>: When feeling depressed, clients journal their feelings, thoughts, and behavior 80 percent of the time.</p>

  <p><em>Measurable Objective B</em>: At the outset of depressive feelings, clients demonstrate (carry out) one positive coping skill, one out of three times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additional suggestions for crafting a measurable objective are summarized next:</p>

<ul>
  <li>List only one objective in each statement or sentence.</li>
  <li>Clients are usually the <em>subject</em> of the statement, unless the focus is on staff members.</li>
  <li>Think of the performance as the <em>action word</em> and not the words that follow it.</li>
  <li>Leave out of the measurable objective the intervention used by the staff member to reach the goal; it only tends to clutter it.</li>
  <li>A condition can sometimes be confused with either the criteria or the subject. Therefore, it is a good idea to state the condition prior to the subject and performance in a measurable objective.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now complete the following exercise related to these additional suggestions.</p>

  </ol>

<h2 id="differences-between-measurable-objectives-of-programs-and-practice">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEASURABLE OBJECTIVES OF PROGRAMS AND PRACTICE</h2>

<p>Often it is difficult to distinguish measurable objectives of programs from practice objectives. As indicated previously, a measurable objective statement typically has the following elements in this order: conditions, subject, performance, and criteria.</p>

<p>Typically, both program and practice objectives will have all these elements. Then how are they different? Practice objectives are usually more detailed and unique to a specific client, whereas program objectives are stated in more general terms to reflect the circumstances of all or some clients who are recipients of programs.</p>

<p>The subjects of programs are all the clients in the program and may be referred to simply as “the clients,” while the subject of a practice objective would be one specific client or client system who could even be named in the objective. Performance words could also be more specific for practice objectives because they can focus in on a specific action that possibly only one client would be expected to perform by a specific time. Likewise, conditions and criteria can be tailored more to the needs of one client in practice than several clients in a program.</p>

<p>For example, an individual client with a substance abuse problem might identify a positive behavior such as “State something positive about myself in front of my family” or “Go out to see a movie if I stay drug free for a week” as part of a measurable objective, but this specificity will not be possible in a measurable objective of a program. A program objective for several clients with similar circumstances will likely be more general, such as “Attend a fun activity outside the home once a week” without identifying further specifics.</p>

  <p><strong>Goals Promoted by the Council on Quality and Leadership in Supports for People with Disabilities</strong></p>

  <p>The Council on Quality and Leadership in Supports for People with Disabilities (1997), an accreditation organization, emphasizes the importance of personal goals for people who have developmental disabilities by taking the position that these people should define their own outcomes from their perspective and experiences. The council emphasizes that there are no standard definitions of personal outcomes, as no two people will define them in the same manner. Instead, personal outcomes reinforce differences and diversity. The authors go on to say that helping clients develop their own personal goals provides three types of opportunities. First, it offers a way of getting further acquainted with the client; second, it provides a focus for organizing resources and coordinating supports to facilitate goals; and third, the goals are the actual outcomes to be used to determine whether the client ultimately achieved what the agency intended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Council on Quality and Leadership in Supports for People with Disabilities emphasizes the importance of personal goals that are truly those of the clients, even if the clients have severe cognitive disabilities. This is a good example to close on not only because it places significant emphasis on personal goals of this organization but also because it expresses the value that clients should be empowered to craft their own goals and objectives.</p>

<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>

<p>The chapter examines two critical components of programs and practice interventions: goals and objectives. Goals and measurable objectives are crafted during the planning or input stage when a program or practice intervention is under construction. Goals and objectives provide a central anchor or reference point for conducting most evaluations. In brief, measurable objectives are statements that usually have four elements: conditions, subject, performance, and criteria. The subject and performance are necessary in every objective, while conditions and criteria are not required but are usually preferred. The subject is the client in most cases. The performance is the action verb describing what the client will be expected to do at the point in time when the goal is reached. Conditions refer to prior observable circumstances that must take place before a performance can occur. The criteria provide a standard of acceptable performance and could take the form of one of the standards introduced earlier (e.g., duration, frequency, degree of accuracy). Several principles about goals and measurable objectives have been discussed that are important in crafting a measurable objective as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Goals and objectives should be useful and have meaning to both the client and the agency.</li>
  <li>Objectives, like goals, are outcomes, not means.</li>
  <li>Crafting objectives is partially an art; there is no one perfect way to craft them.</li>
  <li>An overt indicator is a word or phrase added to the statement in parentheses after a performance to help make the performance more observable.</li>
  <li>Conditions typically are located in a measurable objective statement before the performance, though they can be located after the performance.</li>
  <li>Criteria are often needed in addition to the performance to indicate the level of quality of the performance expected.</li>
  <li>Criteria refer to a special quality of the performance (e.g., duration, accuracy, speed).</li>
</ul>

<p>The next chapter describes evaluations during the second stage, the implementation stage. A range of types of evaluations can be conducted during the implementation of program and practice interventions. The implementation stage is the longest and most varied stage for evaluation activities.</p>
