<h1>Chapter 5 Focusing an Evaluation</h1>

<p class="view">by JAMES R. DUDLEY</p>

<h1 id="chapter-5-focusing-an-evaluation"><strong>CHAPTER 5: Focusing an Evaluation</strong></h1>

<p><strong><em>How do we focus an evaluation?</em></strong></p>

<p>How does an evaluator go about focusing an evaluation? This is primarily step 3 of the Seven Evaluation Steps. Step 3 is determining the purpose of the evaluation. This is an important step that has several ramifications and no simple answers. As was discussed in previous chapters, social programs and practice interventions tend to be complex and multifaceted. Furthermore, they cannot be fully understood in a vacuum. The agency sponsoring the program and its social and political context must also be considered.</p>

<p>The first two of the Seven Evaluation Steps are important to explore prior to moving ahead to focus an evaluation. These steps include (step 1).identifying the problem to be evaluated and (step 2).exploring ways to involve the stakeholders. This chapter elaborates on many of the tasks involved in conducting these two steps and recommends asking several questions initially to gain a fuller understanding of the stakeholders, the clients, and the larger agency context. Once these two steps are explored and have been largely answered, a set of specific guidelines are offered that can assist an evaluator in articulating a focus for an evaluation (step 3).</p>

<h2 id="1-important-initial-questions"><strong>1. IMPORTANT INITIAL QUESTIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Some initial questions should be directed to all stakeholders, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do they believe are the problems and issues that are most important to address in an evaluation?</li>
  <li>Why are these issues important to them?</li>
  <li>What are their perceptions about the intervention or proposed intervention that is to be evaluated?</li>
  <li>What do they perceive to be the goals of this intervention?</li>
  <li>To what extent do they understand the intervention or proposed intervention and how it is supposed to be implemented?</li>
  <li>What would each of the stakeholders hope to accomplish by conducting an evaluation?</li>
  <li>How would they like to use the results of such an evaluation?</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s assume that there is more than one stakeholder, which is very likely. As was discussed in Chapter.1, stakeholders of a social program can potentially include the administrators of the agency sponsoring the program, relevant funding and regulatory agencies, agency staff members, clients, family members of clients, members of the geographic community surrounding the agency, and others.</p>

<p>If we ask each of these stakeholders many of the preceding questions, we are likely to hear a multitude of concerns and perspectives. For example, an agency administrator may want to determine why there is so much staff turnover, a funding agency may want to know whether the program recipients are reaching their designated goals, and staff members may want to explore whether their caseloads are too large. In this instance, all the stakeholders’ responses would need to be reviewed both individually and in conjunction with one another. Concerns of stakeholders may be not only very different from one another but also, in some cases, in conflict. In such cases, decisions would need to be made about how conflicts are addressed and which concerns are given priority.</p>

<h3 id="11-the-input-of-clients-during-the-planning-phase"><strong>1.1 The Input of Clients During the Planning Phase</strong></h3>

<p>Ultimately, a sensitive set of questions needs to be asked of a special group of stakeholders: clients and their families. These questions can offer insights into some of the central reasons for conducting an evaluation, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How can clients benefit from an evaluation of an intervention?</li>
  <li>How can an evaluation contribute to the clients’ well-being?</li>
  <li>How will the results of an evaluation be used to more fully promote the clients’ quality of life?</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, most evaluations are not likely to involve the program recipients in planning, even though the evaluation may focus directly on them. In some ways this is logical, as clients may wonder whether the personnel of the agency know what they are doing if they must ask for client input. Also, many client populations have cognitive limitations, psychiatric and substance abuse diagnoses, or other challenging attributes that may prevent them from offering much substantially useful input. Other clients have involuntary status with the agency; they do not choose to be there. Such clients may have difficulty thinking about how they can help the providers because of their adversarial relationships with them. In addition to all these points, one could argue that the demands on the clients’ time need to be protected and reserved for work they are expected to do in resolving their own problems.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, consulting clients, former clients, prospective clients, and other program recipients in the planning of an evaluation can be especially positive and useful for a program. Indeed, social work ethics expect such involvement. Ultimately, a program or practice approach exists because of clients, who likely know the most about their personal problems and the help they need. They may also have views and suggestions that are pertinent to the methodology to be selected for the evaluation. For example, they may be able to advise an evaluator on whether clients would be more responsive to observations, interviews, questionnaires or another approach.</p>

<p>The participatory action approach, introduced in Chapter.2, assumes that the people who are evaluated can potentially be involved in implementing any or all of the stages of an evaluation. Such involvement largely depends on the perspective of the evaluators and the stakeholders. In the case of planning an evaluation, clients, for example, could be consulted to help in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They can be asked how important the program/practice concerns already identified are to them.</li>
  <li>They can become involved in several ways, such as being interviewed on a relevant topic, sitting on an advisory committee, assisting a collaborative team of stakeholders, or being an informal consultant.</li>
  <li>They can be encouraged to react to the views expressed by other stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="12-the-social-and-political-context-of-the-agency-sponsor"><strong>1.2 The Social and Political Context of the Agency Sponsor</strong></h3>

<p>Once the concerns of all stakeholders are identified, clearly understood, and prioritized, further questions will need to be asked about the agency context of the program. As was discussed in Chapter.1, several contextual factors are likely rele-vant and need to be considered in preparing an evaluation plan. For example, how do agency and governmental policies inform the need for an evaluation? How do decisions get made in the agency and who will participate in decision making and advisory processes involving the evaluation? Will the executive director be the sole decider or will key staff members and possibly an advisory group be the primary decision makers? Also, if staff members are expected to participate in an evaluation (e.g., by filling out forms, preparing clients for participation), such demands on their time and a possible fatigue factor should be explored.</p>

<p>The degree to which an agency sponsor understands what an evaluation is about and values and respects what an evaluation can provide are important is-sues to explore initially. Evaluators will be more likely to succeed in conducting their evaluations if they are respected and understood. Another contextual issue to explore is the extent to which the evaluation will need material resources and time. For example, evaluators will need to be paid if they are not employed by the agency, and release time will need to be provided if the evaluators are staff members of the agency overseeing the evaluation. Also, a budget is inevitable to pay for such things as electronic equipment and statistical software, supplies like postage and paper, the purchase of measurement scales, costs of typing a report, and extra phone use.</p>

<p><strong><em>An Exercise: Example of Decision-Making as a Factor of Influence</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an earlier example in Chapter.1, a graduate student planned an evaluation of the morale of staff members with the assistance of her supervisor. The supervisor seemed quite interested in such a study because she was concerned with occasional complaints of staff, a tendency among some to resist following administrative policies, and more staff turnover than usual in recent years. The student proceeded to construct a questionnaire for staff members to fill out that asked them to comment on the extent to which several work-related issues were a concern. These concerns included salaries, medical and pension benefits, caseloads, supervision, staff meetings, opportunities for staff training and educational advances, and relationships with administrators. When the questionnaire was completed, returned to the student, and tallied, the results revealed that super-visory and administrative relationship issues were most frequently cited as a problem for most staff. Other concerns were also mentioned but much less frequently. When the student shared the results with her supervisor, who then shared them with her supervisor, concerns emerged about the results; the student was told that the study was never fully understood or formally approved by the administration. The student was instructed to write up her report for her social work course assignment but to do nothing more with the results. She was forbidden to share the results in any form with the staff members, who had anticipated hearing about them. Unfortunately, she and her supervisor had not adequately explored the focus of the evaluation initially with key administrative stakeholders before conducting the study. What do you think the student should have done at this point? If staff members asked her to share the findings with them, what should she have said that would be both ethical and consistent with the administrator’s decision? How could this conflict of interest possibly have been prevented at the time of the study’s initial planning and negotiation? What do staff members, administrators, clients, and the student potentially lose from this experience?</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="2-crafting-good-study-questions-for-an-evaluation-as-the-focus"><strong>2. CRAFTING GOOD STUDY QUESTIONS FOR AN EVALUATION AS THE FOCUS</strong></h2>

<p>Before embarking on a specific program or practice investigation, a general focus is needed to guide the evaluator so that he or she knows what is to be investigated. General study questions provide that focus and determine the purpose of an evaluation (step 3). General study questions are broad in nature and open-ended. They serve two purposes. First, they provide parameters for an evaluation, limiting the topic of investigation. Second, they provide just enough specificity for an evaluator to know what is to be explored in a specific sense. In other words, they are not too broad to be unrealistic and not too specific to be too restrictive.</p>

<p>These general study questions are not to be confused with the specific questions that may be asked of participants or the specific behaviors to be observed in a study. A general study question is likely too broad if the number of specific questions it generates seems endless. Similarly, a general study question is likely too narrow if it generates only one or two specific questions. Each general study question when further delineated should generate a manageable number of specific questions to ask participants.
In brief, the best general study questions to ask in an evaluation have several notable characteristics:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Importance: They identify a program concern that is important to address.</li>
  <li>Not too broad or too specific: Each general study question is broad enough to generate several specific questions to be asked (or behaviors to be observed) of the people being studied.</li>
  <li>Feasible: Each question is focused enough to address issues that can be answered within a specific time period and with the available resources.</li>
  <li>Based on the literature:.Previous studies and agency experiences that have focused on this or similar topics have been considered.</li>
  <li>Client feedback: Some clients and/or family members of clients who are personally affected by the program have been asked to participate.</li>
  <li>Clarity: The study questions are well written, clear, and succinct.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next section introduces guidelines to help shape or define these study questions.</p>

<h2 id="3-guidelines-for-focusing-an-evaluation"><strong>3. GUIDELINES FOR FOCUSING AN EVALUATION</strong></h2>

<p>A set of four guidelines can help focus the evaluation and determine its purpose. These four guidelines are based on the evaluation activities of the author and discussions described in other evaluation texts (Bamberger, Rugh, &amp; Mabry, 2019; Linfield &amp; Posavac, 2019; Stecher &amp; Davis, 1987; York, 2009).</p>

<p><strong>Guideline 1:.Identify the specific stage of the program or practice intervention that is to be evaluated.</strong></p>

<p>This is the first guideline. The evaluator is expected to determine the stage in which the evaluation is giving its primary attention (planning, implementation, or outcome). As an evaluator begins to focus an evaluation, the stage of interest should be easy to identify. As discussed in Chapter.2, programs and practice interventions have developmental stages, and evaluations ad-dress important issues in each of these stages. For example, a planning or input stage is when, among other things, the vision for a new program/ practice area can emerge, be developed, and detailed in a proposal. During the outcome stage, the intervention’s impact on client outcomes is the major focus.</p>

<p><strong>Guideline 2:.Identify the program or practice elements to be the focus.</strong></p>

<p>The second guideline is to identify the program or practice elements that are the primary interest and focus of an evaluation. A program or practice element is a distinct entity that is critical to a program or practice area. Figure 5.1 provides a closer look at some of the most important elements evident during the three different stages of the intervention. Each of these elements or combination of elements could become the focus of an evaluation.</p>

<p>For example, during the planning stage, input elements are the focus of the evaluation. Some of the key input elements to choose from are the purposes of a proposed intervention or identifying the prospective client population to receive the intervention. If the focus is on the implementation stage and process elements, the evaluation could focus on observing how the components of a program are being implemented or how different subgroups of the client population are adapting to the intervention. During the outcome stage, both output and outcome elements are an interest of an evaluation. Output elements could be statistics on how many clients complete a program or how many family and group sessions clients attended. Outcome elements are the primary focus of an outcome evaluation and are likely to include different ways of measuring the clients’ progress in reaching their goals.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/l4xlI3Q.png" alt="Figure 5.1" /></p>

<p><strong>Guideline 3:.Craft evaluation questions.</strong></p>

<p>Once the stage to be focused on and the program/practice elements are identified, study questions can be crafted about these elements. This is the third guideline. Ideally, such questions can be best crafted through a brainstorming process that involves as many stakeholders as possible. At this initial point, do not worry if all the questions that are chosen are realistic or not. Because this is a brainstorming step, a creative, open-ended process can be encouraged that yields several evaluation questions. Let’s look at some examples of possible evaluation questions during each of the three stages.</p>

<h3 id="31-possible-evaluation-questions-during-the-planning-stage"><strong>3.1 Possible Evaluation Questions During the Planning Stage</strong></h3>

<p>In the planning stage, the prospective clients can be a key element of an evaluation that require more in-depth examination. Any number of questions could be asked about prospective clients, such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What characteristics provide a pertinent client profile (e.g., age, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, evidence of specific problems, clinical diagnosis, spe-cific medical condition)?</li>
  <li>Where can we find and recruit such prospective clients?</li>
  <li>How can we find out more about their needs and views related to getting help from the proposed program or practice intervention?</li>
  <li>If there are more clients than can be served, what characteristics and qualities of the client population should receive priority?</li>
  <li>What are some obstacles to reaching prospective clients with special circumstances such as people with a clinical diagnosis (e.g., depression) or a specific immigration status?</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the needs of the prospective client group, it is important to explore other sets of elements as well, such as the qualifications of staff members who can provide the proposed services. As Figure 5.1 suggests, additional elements in the planning stage could include determining the facilities needed to house a program, the technologies required to run it, and the costs described in a budget.</p>

<h3 id="32-possible-evaluation-questions-during-the-implementation-stage"><strong>3.2 Possible Evaluation Questions During the Implementation Stage</strong></h3>

<p>During the implementation stage another set of elements are to be considered. Such elements could include, for example, how well various components of a program are being implemented, the performance of current staff members, or renova-tion and expansion of existing facilities and technologies. Any number of evalu-ation questions could be suggested for each of these elements. For example, several questions could be posed about existing staff members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are professional staff members using known best practices?</li>
  <li>Are the racial and ethnic characteristics of staff consistent with the affirma-tive action standards of the agency and the government? If not, how can more minority staff members be recruited?</li>
  <li>Are staff members trained to effectively help clients with mental health problems (e.g., helping people with a mental illness integrate socially in the community)?</li>
  <li>How do case managers use their time? How much time, on average, do they devote to direct contact with clients? To evaluation activities? To advocacy? To paperwork?</li>
  <li>Why is there such a high turnover rate of occupational therapists or social workers in the program?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="33-possible-evaluation-questions-during-the-outcome-stage"><strong>3.3 Possible Evaluation Questions During the Outcome Stage</strong></h3>

<p>This stage involves two kinds of elements, output and outcome. Output elements are manifestations of such things as resources that have been used or the extent to which clients have participated in the program. For example, resource outputs could be such things as the number of staff or volunteer contact hours with clients, the costs of run-ning the program, and the wear and tear on physical resources. Client outputs could be the number of clients who have attended at least some program sessions, the number who have successfully completed the program, and the number who have dropped out.</p>

<p>Many evaluation questions could be raised about each output element. Let’s take the subgroup of clients completing the program as an example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the demographic (e.g., gender, socioeconomic group, ethnicity, age) characteristics of clients who completed the program?</li>
  <li>How long did it take for clients to complete the program? Which clients needed more time than others? How much professional staff time was needed to help them on average?</li>
  <li>What are the characteristics of those who dropped out of the program early? At what stages did they most frequently drop out? What factors could explain why they dropped out?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Outcome elements</em></strong> are a special type of output element that reflects the impact of the program/practice intervention on the clients after they completed it. These elements are usually client-focused and reflect a measure of progress or lack of progress in achieving their goals. Output and outcome elements are sometimes difficult to distinguish. For example, successful completion of a job-training program is more of an output element because it is not an actual indication of client progress, whereas finding a job because of training is more of an outcome element. Similarly, completing rigorous drug rehabilitation counseling is a practice output but discontinued drug use is the ultimate desired outcome. When you think about it, completion of a counseling program is not an adequate justification for a program to continue, but making progress toward discontinuing drug use is.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exercise on Outcome Elements</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Defining outcome elements tends to require more effort and creativity than defining output elements. The following two questions pose examples of this. Try to answer each question:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>What would be a valuable measure of improved marital relations for clients in a family agency beyond completing weekly sessions for three months?</li>
  <li>Beyond an initial physical placement, how can we know whether a foster care agency was successful in placing children with disabilities in family home care over time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ultimately, evaluation questions focusing on outcome elements ask whether the clients who have completed a program function considerably better than they did when they first began receiving services. Statistical significance and clinical significance are two different ways that we can determine if clients made enough progress in their functioning. Statistical measures are often used to determine not only whether clients have made progress but also whether that progress is statistically significant. If evaluators decide that clinical significance is more important than statistical significance, the question is, did the clients meet the clinical criteria of success based on improving their outcome scores from pretest to post-test? More information is provided about statistical and clinical significance in Chapter.9.</p>

<p>In some agencies, it is important to determine both outputs and outcomes for staff members as well as clients. For example, an agency may want to know what new skills a staff member learned from attending a specific training session or work-shop. This can be an important question, especially if the skills are critical in effectively helping clients. Note that the learning of such skills could be either an output element or an outcome element. They are output elements in the context of the program that serves clients, but they are outcome elements if the training workshop is the sole focus of an evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Guideline 4:.Identify supportive and resistant forces.</strong></p>

<p>Both types of forces need to be considered and addressed before deciding about the evaluation questions to use to conduct the evaluation. This is the fourth and final guideline for focusing an evaluation. The previous guideline is largely meant to be a creative, brainstorming step that does not address feasibility issues. However, feasibility becomes an important consideration with this guideline. In addition, the contextual issues of the program and agency become more important. There are two basic questions to ask about the larger context of the program:.(a) What re-sources are available to support the evaluation? and (b).What factors do we need to consider that could cause resistance or interference in conducting the evaluation?</p>

<h3 id="34-identify-supportive-resources"><strong>3.4 Identify Supportive Resources</strong></h3>

<p>Identifying resources to support the evaluation is often critical. Most evaluations will be feasible only if they have resources available to support them. In some settings, these resource factors may be referred to as strengths of the agency context. It is important to consciously and deliberately identify potential resources because these supportive factors are often present but unrecognized. In instances in which such resources are required, they can be more easily engaged if you know about them and have considered them from the beginning.</p>

<p>Possible examples of resources or strengths that support an evaluation include any number of things. The subsequent partial list of resources can help evaluators and stakeholders begin to consider them.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Strong interest in conducting an evaluation among some or all stakeholders</li>
  <li>Prior agency experience in completing useful evaluations, especially successful ones</li>
  <li>Financial support for an evaluation</li>
  <li>Awareness among stakeholders of the problem (or concern) inherent in a program that is the focus of the evaluation</li>
  <li>An openness among stakeholders to examine a problem in greater depth rather than just on the surface</li>
  <li>Some understanding, expertise, and respect for evaluations among stakeholders</li>
  <li>Expressed interest in the evaluation by clients and their families</li>
  <li>Staff members’ interest in helping with the evaluation</li>
  <li>Openness to an evaluator as a helpful resource and ally of the program or practice area</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="35-examine-resistant-factors"><strong>3.5 Examine Resistant Factors</strong></h3>

<p>While it is important to examine the factors that can support an evaluation, resistant factors are also extremely important to consider, as they may determine the success or failure of the evaluation. They can also be decisive in determining whether an evaluation should even be conducted. The evaluation of staff morale described earlier in the chapter is an example of an evaluation that probably should not have been conducted.
Once resistant factors are identified, it may be critical to explore their potential impact and address them if warranted. In some cases, this involves discussions with resistant or misinformed stakeholders to listen and respond to their views. This may also involve a decision to seek an outside evaluator with more expertise.
Examples of resistant factors, like resources, include any number of things. The following list can help evaluators and stakeholders begin to identify them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are there time limitations that may preclude conducting an evaluation?</li>
  <li>Are the costs of conducting an evaluation so high that it is not affordable to do so?</li>
  <li>Is the payoff risky in terms of what the findings might suggest?</li>
  <li>Is the type of evaluation that is wanted so subjective that it may not be feasible or even acceptable to some stakeholders?</li>
  <li>Could the results of the evaluation suggest a need for a change that the agency is not prepared to consider?</li>
  <li>Are there limits to what can be changed about the program, given the funding agency’s requirements or limited resources?</li>
  <li>Are the special interests of various stakeholders and others likely to lead to counterproductive results or divisiveness?</li>
  <li>Does the agency lack the expertise to conduct such a study?</li>
  <li>If there is no need to justify such an evaluation to the funding agency, “why rock the boat?”</li>
  <li>Will there be problems in gaining access to client data?</li>
  <li>Do stakeholders and/or the collaborative team have the required creativity and flexibility to implement the evaluation?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="4-a-practical-tool"><strong>4. A PRACTICAL TOOL</strong></h2>

<p>Stecher and Davis (1987) offer a practical way to begin focusing an evaluation on issues important to the agency. Their exercise begins by identifying the program or practice elements that are of concern, followed by writing general study questions, identifying and engaging potential resources to support the evaluation, identi-fying and addressing resistant factors, and finally considering relevant evaluation procedures. This exercise is intended as a creative way to quickly focus an evaluation on one or more concerns.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zSfZoCx.png" alt="Figure 5.2" /></p>

<p>Figure 5.2 can be used to explore two program or practice concerns of importance to an agency at the same time. Feel free to use it for that purpose. You may be surprised how quickly you can find a focus for your evaluation. After identifying one or two program or practice elements as a possible focus, work across Figure 5.2 from left to right for each element. In the first column, identify the element. In the second column, identify one or more general study questions to explore for the element. For example, if a practice element is the high rate of client cancellations and no-shows for appointments with social workers, a general study question could be, why are there so many client cancellations and no-shows in this practice area? This is a good study question because it can lead to several specific questions such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What percentage of the clients show up for the initially scheduled interview with the social worker? What reasons do clients give, if any, when they do not show up?</li>
  <li>Are the same clients missing appointments over time?</li>
  <li>Are these clients rescheduling canceled appointments?</li>
  <li>What are the characteristics of clients who are canceling or not showing up for appointments?</li>
  <li>Do people from specific ethnic, age, or gender groups cancel more often than members of other groups?</li>
  <li>Do the clients report having illnesses preventing them from showing up for appointments?</li>
  <li>Do clients have adequate transportation to get to appointments?</li>
  <li>What is the average time that a client waits to see a social worker after an intake interview?</li>
  <li>Do clients have children who need to be cared for at home or at the agency while they are in a session?</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, in the third column of Figure 5.2, identify potential available resources that are likely to be valuable in supporting a study that addresses each identified study question. Then, in the fourth column, do the same for resistant factors that could potentially work against such an evaluation. A final step in the far-right column is to begin considering overall evaluation procedures, such as a one-group pretest and posttest design, a needs assessment interview of prospective clients, or observations of worker–client relationships through a one-way mirror.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Examples of Questions Formulated by Students</em></strong>
This section offers several examples of how students in an MSW program used this exercise to develop a focus for the evaluations they conducted as part of a course assignment. Note that many of these general study questions focus on practice more than programs, and they are also often quite specific. These are only preferences for this student group and not necessarily what other evaluators may want to choose to do.</p>

  <p><strong><em>Study Questions Focusing on Clients’ Issues</em></strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Encouraging client diversity</strong>
      <ul>

<p>The final step in the focusing exercise in Figure 5.2 involves exploring possible evaluation procedures needed to investigate each study question. This topic is covered in much more depth in later chapters. Identifying evaluation procedures is an important consideration in the focusing exercise because the evaluation questions eventually selected must be realistic to answer. Put another way, a successful evaluation requires feasible evaluation procedures. Evaluation questions have the potential of addressing major concerns about a program or practice intervention, but there is no point in proceeding with an investigation without a realistic plan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Example of Efforts to Formulate Feasible General Study Questions</em></strong></p>

  <p>A substance abuse agency wanted to find out whether its clinical program was successful in bringing sobriety to its clients. This could be the ultimate type of question that any agency wants to ask:.Can the agency claim that the program is responsible for changing the lives of its clients related to the goals of the program? Yet, this is not a feasible question to answer unless the agency can do all the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Develop a valid measure of sobriety, the outcome variable.</li>
    <li>Conduct an experimental design and randomly assign participants to a treatment or control group.</li>
    <li>Find the funds and other resources to conduct such an evaluation.</li>
    <li>Stay committed to the evaluation from beginning to end.</li>
    <li>Conduct a follow-up evaluation to find out whether clients maintained sobriety over a reasonably long period of time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A more feasible evaluation question could be, Are most clients making statistically significant improvements in their specific goals by the time they complete the program?</p>

<h2 id="5-summary"><strong>5. SUMMARY</strong></h2>

<p>The chapter offers practical steps that an evaluator can take to develop a focus for the evaluation. Issues to address prior to focusing an evaluation are discussed first. One issue is to give special attention to how clients and their advocates can be involved as stakeholders. The chapter goes on to describe a set of four guidelines to follow in bringing a meaningful focus to an evaluation. Specific tools, exercises, and examples are included to help the reader begin to work on focusing their own evaluations. Several examples of MSW students’ efforts to focus their evaluations are presented as well. The next two chapters consider important topics of the planning stage, a needs assessment and crafting goals and objectives for a proposed intervention.</p>

<h2 id="6-discussion-questions-and-assignments"><strong>6. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select a program or practice element from the input stage, implementation stage, or outcome stage listed in Figure 5.1 and identify three general study questions that could be investigated about this element at your field placement or the agency where you are employed.</li>
  <li>Attempt to arrive at a focus for an evaluation at your agency using Figure 5.2. Choose one program or practice element that you would recommend be pursued in any of the three stages. Consult your supervisor as you explore each of these steps so that your focus will be useful to the agency.</li>
  <li>In the exercise described in question 2, identify one supportive resource and one resistant factor related to conducting the evaluation you have proposed. How could the supportive resource assist you in implementing your proposed evaluation? What steps could you take to address or counteract the resistant factor?</li>
  <li>Two questions are posed in the “Exercise on Outcome Elements” box in the chapter. Select one of the questions and create a measurable outcome for it.</li>
