<h1>Chapter 6 Needs Assessments</h1>

<p class="view">by JAMES R. DUDLEY</p>

<p><strong>PART III</strong></p>

<p>The Planning or Input Stage</p>

<p>art III describes the evaluation tasks to be completed during the planning stage of a proposed program or practice intervention. Based on the three-stage approach, the planning stage comes prior to the implementation of the intervention. Several crucial tasks are to be completed during this stage relevant to an evaluation. They include designing the intervention, identifying funding sources, identifying and recruiting clients, and hiring staff members. Two additional tasks during the planning stage are considered evaluation activities: conducting a needs assessment and crafting goals and objectives for the proposed intervention. Chapter 6 discusses needs assessments and their importance in shaping a program or practice intervention. Chapter 7 delves into how to craft goals and objectives for a new intervention so that the clients’ progress can be measured.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-6-needs-assessments">CHAPTER 6 Needs Assessments</h1>

<p><em>How do we know that there is a need for a new program or practice intervention?</em></p>

<p>A critically important task during the planning stage is determining whether there is a need for a new program or practice intervention (see Figure 6.1). Typically, this involves conducting a needs assessment. A needs assessment is an organized, systematic effort to assess the need for something, in this case the need for a new program or practice intervention. Conducting a needs assessment of some of the prospective recipients of a proposed intervention is wise to do because they are some of the people who will choose to use it or not. The more that the program or practice intervention considers their specific needs, the more likely it is that they will find it relevant and use it. It is important to become informed about a group of prospective clients before designing a new intervention to help them because valuable resources are to be committed. The planning stage is the primary time period when this documentation is expected to be completed. During the planning stage, various stakeholders can identify, document, advocate, and debate the need for a new program or practice intervention. In other words, well-conceived, well-conceptualized interventions are typically preceded by an important planning process that involves a variety of helpful inputs. While a needs assessment is a primary task during this stage, it is also important to note that additional needs assessments could be conducted after a program is underway to further confirm the underlying needs of the client group. Chapter 6 focuses primarily on issues related to step 1 (identify the problem or concern to be evaluated) and step 2 (identify and explore ways to involve stakeholders) of the Seven Evaluation Steps.</p>

<p>Although rigorous planning makes sense before implementation of an intervention, such preparation is often ignored or underplayed for many debatable reasons. The agency provider may be rushed into getting a program under way prematurely because of deadlines imposed by a funding agency or an agency board. Or perhaps a needs assessment mistakenly seems unnecessary because there is plenty of anecdotal data available in support of an intervention. Another frequent excuse is that there is no one demanding or requiring a systematic documentation. Finally, program administrators sometimes are not well prepared to administer the necessary planning tasks before them. In this case, this chapter can provide administrators with guidelines and tasks for planning a new program.</p>

<h2 id="the-logic-model">THE LOGIC MODEL</h2>

<p>The logic model is both an organizing framework and a tool to theoretically analyze a program as it is being developed. It can also be used to analyze a practice intervention. The logic model helps to highlight how the three stages and the tasks within these stages can be logically linked into an organic whole, beginning with determining what the problems of prospective clients are (in the planning stage) and culminating in determining whether the client outcomes have been reached (in the outcome stage). In brief, the tasks especially pertinent to the logic model at each stage of development are listed in Figure 6.2.</p>

<p>The example that follows outlines some of the steps taken by one group using the logic model in implementing a parenting education program for teenage mothers (Ross, Lipsey, &amp; Freeman, 2004). Some steps are also missing. As you can see, a strength is that the outcomes are established at three different points in time—initial, intermediate, and long term—reflecting what is specifically expected at the completion of the program and at two later points in time. A weakness of this example is that the clients’ problems, unmet needs, and the underlying causes are not stated during the input steps. Because of the absence of this information, it is not apparent whether the problem is clearly linked to the intervention and outcomes.</p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, the logic model is implemented within a larger context of policies, administrative leadership styles, communication patterns, financial issues, and other factors that inevitably have an influence. The influence of the policies of the proposed intervention is important to mention here. A helpful first step in using the logic model would be to identify the specific policies of the program that define the problem of interest and how it can be alleviated. These policies can then serve as a guide in walking through the steps in Figure 6.2. For example, if the parenting education program is to help teenage mothers raise their babies in healthy ways, hopefully the policies of this program can be identified to help determine what specific problems and needs are to be addressed by the program. Then goals and objectives could be crafted that would be the basis for determining what program activities and teaching materials are needed by this specific group of teenage mothers. In short, devising an effective program to help these mothers could be achieved by moving through the series of steps of the logic model beginning with the program’s policies.</p>

<p>Introducing the logic model into the program-planning process has the potential of creating fundamental changes in how a proposed program is shaped and implemented, especially when the effort is initiated during the early stage of conceptualizing a program. Aspects of the logic model are increasingly being built into funding agencies’ requirements for most grant proposals. Grant proposals are expected to document such things as the links between clients’ problems, needs, causes, and the program approach proposed to help them. This and later chapters describe some of the issues that are raised and addressed when the logic model is incorporated into the planning process, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identifying the links between pertinent client problems and specific needs;</li>
  <li>Determining how these problems and needs relate to their underlying causes;</li>
  <li>Identifying the goals of the program or practice intervention based on the problems, needs, and underlying causes for this group of clients;</li>
  <li>Crafting measurable objectives for these goals;</li>
  <li>Logically linking these goals and objectives to an intervention that is evidence-based and can help these clients achieve their goals and objectives; and</li>
  <li>Anticipating that the introduction of the intervention will result in these clients progressing significantly toward the goals and measurable objectives initially identified and crafted.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-link-between-problems-and-needs">THE LINK BETWEEN PROBLEMS AND NEEDS</h2>

<p>The logic model is introduced during the planning stage to stress the importance of beginning by identifying the clients’ problems, needs, and their underlying causes. A note about the link between needs and problems is helpful here. The reference to a needs assessment may imply that problems are not pertinent. For example, why isn’t this process referred to as a problem assessment? Although clients’ problems and needs are similar, there are some important differences. Some prefer using the term needs over problems when referring to the nature of the help clients receive because it puts a more positive face on the focus and less on client deficits. Needs may also imply something that is manageable and capable of being changed, whereas a large social problem may seem more insurmountable and unsolvable, at least in the immediate future. Needs also refers to some aspects of a problem that can be immediately addressed, while that may not be possible for other aspects of the problem.</p>

<p>DePoy and Gilson (2003) view needs as a systematic, evidence-based phenomenon linked to all or part of the problem. They suggest that identification of the need-related aspects of a problem helps specify the conditions and actions necessary to address the focus of the problem. For the purposes of this text, a version of DePoy and Gilson’s definition of needs is used. Needs are considered only part of an overall problem that is identified by a client and selected because there is evidence that it can be overcome, alleviated, or ameliorated by an intervention.</p>

<p>Note that the problems in the examples of Table 6.1 are usually stated in broad terms that may fit many different client circumstances. In contrast, the needs linked to each problem are more specific and intended to fit some clients with these specific circumstances and not others. For example, truancy is a problem that could be related to any number of needs going unmet. In Table 6.1, truant students face two types of needs: trying to cope with challenging family conflicts and needing more supervised time before and after school because parents are employed outside of the home during the day. In other instances, truancy could be related to a lack of preparedness for academic courses, a lack of interest in school, a substance abuse problem, interpersonal difficulties pertaining to acceptance at school, difficulty adapting as a recent immigrant, and so on.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4vj71sX.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<h2 id="the-underlying-causes">THE UNDERLYING CAUSES</h2>

<p>So, a need is an aspect of a larger problem identified by a client and perceived to be amenable to change. Meeting a set of needs, then, is the intended focus of a proposed intervention. However, before rushing too quickly into the design of such a program, another important question is, What are the underlying causes of the problem that prevent the need from being met? This is a critical question for stakeholders to explore if a proposed program or practice intervention is to be designed to directly confront underlying causes. Underlying causes partially reflect barriers and other resistant factors that prevent needs from being met. Therefore, identified needs are likely to be met only if the underlying causes are understood and confronted.</p>

<p>Let’s return to the example of the five problems and specific needs described in Table 6.1. Once we identify the problems, needs, and underlying causes, as described in Table 6.2, we discover that we have a more complete understanding of how a program should be designed to be effective.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QaaW6g9.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Let’s look more closely at the first example in Table 6.2 of inadequate housing as the problem and plumbing repairs as the specific need to be met. We might next ask why the plumbing (and other aspects of housing) has not been addressed. After all, most plumbing repairs seem mostly straightforward and relatively easy to make. Yet, the example suggests that the group of clients with this housing problem have modest incomes, no funds available for major repairs, and no plumbing repair skills or resources available even if funds were found.</p>

<p>You may still wonder why it is so important to identify and distinguish problems, needs, and underlying causes. This will become more evident in later chapters when the focus is on developing an intervention that will succeed in meeting unmet needs. For now, it is important to remember that an effective new program or practice intervention must be linked to a clear sense of what the problem and needs are and how they can be solved. Let’s look next at how needs assessments are important for developing programs. Later we will look more closely at practice interventions.</p>

<h2 id="input-stage-and-planning-a-proposed-program">INPUT STAGE AND PLANNING A PROPOSED PROGRAM</h2>

<p>The input stage of program development is when planning becomes the major focus. Several important tasks are completed in this stage, including identifying the prospective client population that is to be the focus of a new program and the problems of the clients that the proposed program is to address. Here is where the complex tasks of exploring the problem in more depth occur. The clients’ problem, the specific needs that are part of the problem, and the underlying causes are all a focus of this task. Once the client population has been identified in general terms and the target problem has been examined in more depth, a decision needs to be made as to how to assess, in a systematic way, the clients’ problems and needs. This is where a needs assessment becomes front and center.
Before delving into the mechanics of a needs assessment, it is important to emphasize that this is both a subjective and a political process. Meenaghan, Kilty, and McNutt (2004) identify some key overall social and political factors that can influence the implementation of a needs assessment. They recommend that evaluators and stakeholders be fully aware of the people and groups involved in each of the following activities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Who chooses what problems are to be examined?</li>
  <li>Who identifies what information is collected and why?</li>
  <li>Who analyzes and interprets the information that is collected?</li>
  <li>Who controls access to dissemination of the information collected?</li>
</ul>

<p>These activities are critical to the shape that a needs assessment will take, how the data will be analyzed, the results that will be emphasized and ignored, who will have access to the results, and how the results will be disseminated. These points illustrate how the evaluation process is always a political process as well as a research undertaking, as mentioned in Chapter 1. The specific stakeholders can be crucial in influencing this process. Thus, it is important to identify all relevant parties who have a stake in the results and to get them involved as early as possible. It also means that the stakeholders should be as fully involved as possible in every step. The participant action approach and the empowerment approach, described in Chapter 2, are good models to follow in this regard.</p>

<h2 id="why-conduct-a-needs-assessment">WHY CONDUCT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT?</h2>

<p>Why conduct a needs assessment? A broad, systematic research effort like a needs assessment can be highly beneficial in addressing many community-wide needs and problems. Most important, such an assessment can provide valuable information for understanding a specific social problem that is troubling a local community. The alternatives—depending on hearsay or a few case examples as evidence or having hunches about a problem—are not enough documentation to take the problem seriously.</p>

<p>Needs assessments are particularly useful when considering a new policy or program initiative or when considering changes to or discontinuation of an existing program. Also, if outside funding sources (e.g., federal, state, or local government; private foundations; corporate support) are needed to support a program, the documentation from a needs assessment takes on even greater importance.</p>

<p>A needs assessment can answer several important questions. Consider the example of parenting children in a low-income neighborhood. Several questions could be asked about their parenting in this neighborhood, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To what extent and how are the (biological, step, surrogate) parents actively involved in raising their children?</li>
  <li>To what extent and how are the parents economically able to provide for their children?</li>
  <li>What problems do mothers and fathers face in their roles as parents?</li>
  <li>What trends are evident in teen pregnancy, unmarried parenting, single parenting, and divorce? Are these family patterns increasing or decreasing?</li>
  <li>To what extent do services exist in the community to help parents with their parental roles?</li>
  <li>What are the demographic characteristics of the mothers and fathers who use existing services? What are the characteristics of those who do not use existing services?</li>
  <li>What barriers exist in accessing existing services?</li>
  <li>What service gaps are evident?</li>
  <li>What new policy initiatives could benefit these parents?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-purposes-of-needs-assessments">SOME PURPOSES OF NEEDS ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>You may ask, “What good will a needs assessment do, anyway?” Of course, there are no guarantees, but a needs assessment of a particular group of people can produce many positive benefits. Further, the more stakeholders and potential stakeholders are involved and committed to such an assessment and informed by it, the more likely it is that a genuine community-wide concern for a client group will emerge.</p>

<p>While a needs assessment is particularly important in documenting the need for a new program, it can have other important purposes as well, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Determining the adequacy of existing programs.</li>
  <li>Determining the adequacy of existing informal resources.</li>
  <li>Assessing barriers to client accessibility.</li>
  <li>Obtaining data for crafting goals and measurable objectives for a new program.</li>
</ul>

<p>A brief description follows of how a needs assessment can be useful when creating new programs, determining the adequacy of existing programs and existing informal resources, determining client accessibility barriers, and crafting measurable objectives for new programs.</p>

<h3 id="new-programs">New Programs</h3>

<p>One purpose of a needs assessment is to explore in more depth whether a new program is needed. A key question in this exploration is whether there are enough prospective clients to warrant such an initiative. Specific questions could be asked about the activities or services that the respondents would be interested in using, possible priorities for some activities over others, how important the activities are to clients, and the times when they would be most likely desired and used. Another set of questions can explore possible barriers that prevent some people from accessing any of the activities. Potential barriers could emerge related to decisions about specific times a program is to be offered, the location, costs or whether fees should be charged, and possible psychological issues related to such things as how welcomed clients would feel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Example of Needs-Assessment Questions on Family Planning</p>

  <p>Asked of Potential Recipients</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do you have an interest in planning the size of your family?</li>
    <li>Would you consider using any existing birth control methods that are available?</li>
    <li>Would you have an interest in discussing your family-planning needs and questions with a professional counselor if one were available?</li>
    <li>What are some questions that you would want to discuss with a counselor about birth control?</li>
    <li>Would you be open to possibly obtaining a birth-control method such as an IUD if a program was available to fit one for you?</li>
    <li>Do you currently have easy access to the birth-control methods you want to use?</li>
    <li>Would you be comfortable using a family-planning program if it existed?</li>
    <li>What would be your hesitations in using such a program, if any?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="adequacy-of-existing-programs">Adequacy of Existing Programs</h3>

<p>A needs assessment can also be very useful in determining the extent to which programs of other agencies are already available to meet the needs of a specific group that is the focus of a new proposed program. This line of questioning naturally precedes attempts to document the need for a new program, even though this step may not be taken seriously because of competition among agencies for resources. Assessing the existence of programs of other agencies similar in nature to a proposed program is desirable to determine whether the need is already being met. Such a task is important not only to avoid program duplication but also to explore and create complementary and collaborative relationships with other agencies and their programs.</p>

<p>An assessment of existing programs sponsored by other agencies begins with finding them. Next, these programs could be visited and evaluated in terms of their relevance to the needs of the specific group targeted for the proposed new program. The assessments should also explore the ability of existing programs to serve additional clients, particularly the targeted group that is the concern of the initiators of the proposed program.</p>

<p>The sources of information for a needs assessment of existing programs could include the administrators and service-delivery staff members of the agencies that provide such services. Assessment tools can help obtain information on such topics as demographic characteristics of the people who currently use these services, characteristics of those who tend not to use them, explorations of the nature of their services, and any indicators that these programs are effective. The barriers that keep some groups of people from accessing these programs could also be explored and service gaps documented. In addition, this assessment process could explore the other agencies’ views about introducing a new proposed program.</p>

<h3 id="adequacy-of-existing-informal-resources">Adequacy of Existing Informal Resources</h3>

<p>While it is important to assess whether existing programs are available to address a pressing need, it can be equally important to assess the adequacy of existing informal resources in addressing the need. Informal resources could include extended family; other family members not in the household; neighborhood clubs, recreation centers, and civic groups; advocacy groups; churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious groups; libraries, museums, and theatrical resources; and so on. Often informal resources are the first line of defense and the easiest resources for clients to approach when they need help.</p>

<h3 id="client-accessibility">Client Accessibility</h3>

<p>There are many potential barriers that can inevitably discourage some people from using the services of a program. They could be, for example, an unfriendly receptionist, a delay in responding to client inquiries, a lack of clarity about the purpose of a program, or a view that a program is insensitive to a client group’s culture. Access issues such as these are important to consider in the planning stage of program development. Serious consideration must be given to any group that is to become recipients of a program and to the factors that could prevent any of them from using the program’s services.</p>

<p>Chapter 8 describes several factors that could be sources of confusion or resistance that keep potential program recipients from using a program’s services. The most effective way to identify these access issues is often to ask potential recipients to share their views on accessibility. Such questions can be included as a component of a needs-assessment questionnaire or interview with recipients. Stakeholders who are concerned about the recipients can also be enlisted to share their views. Also, access issues can be relevant to consider when selecting a specific program approach such as interventions with individuals, families, or groups or deciding on what kinds of staff members to hire.</p>

<h3 id="crafting-goals-and-objectives">Crafting Goals and Objectives</h3>

<p>An additional purpose of a needs assessment can be to gather data pertinent to the goals of a proposed program. Goals of proposed programs tend to be crafted from the providers’ perspectives. To address this potential bias, a needs assessment could be used to obtain specific data from the perspectives of potential recipients. Most of the questions could be open-ended explorations. Questions can be designed to obtain information related to the proposed goals and objectives of the program by exploring the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do clients perceive as realistic goals for themselves?</li>
  <li>What do they perceive to be some measurable objectives? This can be obtained by asking how things might look different once they reach their goals?</li>
  <li>How motivated are they to seek these goals?</li>
  <li>How important are the goals to others in their immediate circle of support?</li>
</ul>

<p>The next chapter is completely devoted to crafting goals and objectives for new programs and practice interventions.</p>

<h2 id="methods-of-conducting-needs-assessments">METHODS OF CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, conducting a needs assessment of some of the prospective recipients of a program is wise to do as they are some of the people who will choose whether to use the program or not. The more that the program considers their specific needs, the more likely it is that they will find it relevant and use it. The specific methods for conducting a needs assessment can take many forms, including</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use existing data.</li>
  <li>Administer a questionnaire.</li>
  <li>Conduct interviews.</li>
  <li>Conduct focus groups.</li>
  <li>Arrange community and public forums.</li>
  <li>Observe.</li>
  <li>Any combination of these methods.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="documenting-needs-using-existing-data">Documenting Needs Using Existing Data</h3>

<p>Sometimes existing data are available to provide all or some of the documentation of the need for a new program. If so, this may be the place to start. Thus, the first recommended step in documenting the need for a new program is to explore whether relevant data already exist. This will be the least expensive way to conduct a needs assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steps for Reviewing Existing Data</p>

  <p>DePoy and Gilson (2003) recommend a rigorous set of steps to effectively and efficiently review existing data for a needs assessment.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Determine the purpose of the review.</li>
    <li>Set some search parameters.</li>
    <li>Access relevant databases.</li>
    <li>Obtain relevant information from the databases.</li>
    <li>Organize the selected information.</li>
    <li>Critically evaluate the information.</li>
    <li>Prepare a report of the selected information.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at the numerous sources from which relevant existing data can be potentially obtained (steps 3 and 4 in DePoy and Gilson’s, 2008, list). There are often several relevant choices: local studies, governmental studies, studies of research firms and academic units, secondary research, data available from social agencies, and mapping resources. Let’s take a closer look at what each of these sources can offer.</p>

<h3 id="local-studies">Local Studies</h3>

<p>Local studies can be an excellent source of data because they could include the actual client populations considered for the proposed new program. Local studies also may have more credibility with some stakeholders, especially when sponsored by colleagues in their geographic area. Local agencies may include the local United Way office, a local governmental agency, or the local newspaper. All these organizations are known to conduct such studies. A simple way to begin an investigation of local studies is to do a Google search of the name of your community, county government, university, or local agency, followed by the words needs assessment. For example, a United Way agency in North Carolina conducted a needs assessment that focused on education, housing and poverty, and health and mental health (United Way of Central Carolinas, 2011).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of United Way Needs Assessment</strong></p>

  <p>The purpose of this study (United Way of Central Carolinas, 2011) was to assess the most critical needs of the five-county Charlotte region and to identify the most significant and effective channels to address these needs. To accomplish this, the research team focused on United Way’s three current funding areas: Children and Youth; Crisis, Housing and Stability; and Health and Mental Health. The components of the study included a review of previous community assessments, secondary data analysis, a survey of local human service agencies, and a series of four expert panels—one for each of the funding areas and a general panel.</p>

  <p>Across the greatest needs of education, housing and poverty, and health/ mental health, two intertwining themes pervaded—the need for preventive services and public awareness. Accordingly, this report makes several key recommendations to strengthen United Way’s impact in the community. These include suggestions to fund programs that encourage prevention and campaigns that educate the public about the community’s needs and available services, fund a broader range of programs than just direct service providers, and improve the funding process itself so that it is more focused and can make serious progress on specific causes instead of spreading funding thinly across the entire spectrum.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="governmental-studies">Governmental Studies</h3>

<p>Governmental agencies at the national and state levels also conduct studies of relevance to social service agencies. Two good sources are the U.S. Census (www.census.gov) and the National Center for Health Statistics (www.cdc.gov/nchs). The U.S. Census conducts not only a census of the entire U.S. population every ten years but also numerous smaller studies, known as Current Population Surveys, with nationally representative samples in between years. The surveys are conducted on numerous topics, have a good reputation for accuracy and reliability, and often are pertinent in documenting the needs of many subgroups in a population (e.g., elderly, families, and children).</p>

<h2 id="studies-of-research-firms-and-academic-units">Studies of Research Firms and Academic Units</h2>

<p>Many research firms and academic groups are also known to conduct and disseminate large-scale studies. Reports on some of these studies can be found on the Internet. Such firms often have large representative samples that can be generalized to even larger populations. A good example is Child Trends (www.childtrends.org), a nonprofit, nonpartisan research organization dedicated to improving the lives of children by conducting research and providing science-based information to improve the decisions, programs, and policies that affect children. Child Trends produces books, research briefs, and full research reports on such topics as child poverty, child welfare, health, marriage and family structure, teen sex and pregnancy, parenting, and family dynamics. They widely disseminate their reports, which are often free.</p>

<p>University-conducted studies can also be useful and are often reported on university websites and in professional journals. Several professional journals focus specifically on program and practice evaluations, including the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluation: The International Journal of Theory, Research and Practice</li>
  <li>Evaluation Review: A Journal of Applied Social Research</li>
  <li>Evaluation and the Health Professions</li>

  <li>Evaluation and Program Planning: An International Journal</li>
  <li>American Journal of Evaluation</li>
  <li>Practical Assessment, Research and Evaluation</li>
  <li>Canadian Journal of Program Evaluation</li>
  <li>Evaluation reports can also be found in many professional social work journals, such as Social Work, Child Welfare, Families in Society, and The Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Needs Assessment in a Professional Journal</strong></p>

  <p>Weinman, Buzi, and Smith (2005) focused on the risk factors, service needs, and mental health issues of 143 young fathers (aged sixteen  to  thirty-three) when they entered a fatherhood program. They found that almost 70 percent were unemployed, 42 percent had been in jail, and 39 percent were school dropouts. The most frequent mental health issues that the fathers identified included sadness and depression, nervousness and tension, helplessness, and aggression. Although the fathers identified these and other risk factors, they did not often request services to address them; their most frequently requested services were related to jobs and training. Because the results of this study were mostly problem-focused, the authors recommended that future assessments add questions using  a strengths perspective.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="secondary-research">Secondary Research</h3>

<p>Another option to consider when relying on other studies is secondary research or data already collected from a previous study. This option is pertinent only if a data set from a previous study exists and is available. Many research firms offer their data sets to interested parties for secondary analysis, and usually for a reasonable fee.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Study Using Secondary Analysis</strong></p>

  <p>O’Donnell (1999) conducted a secondary analysis of data from an earlier federally funded research and demonstration project on casework practice in kinship foster care. Kinship foster care refers to the placement of children in the home of  a relative, approved by the agency as a foster parent. The data were collected in the prior study from caseworkers in two private child-welfare agencies. O’Donnell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>reported on a subset of the original data set that focused on the involvement of African American fathers. His findings documented the lack of fathers’ involvement in the caseworkers’ assessment and planning of foster-care services for their children. Although useful secondary data were available about several of these fathers, the data had limitations because they emphasized their problems and not their strengths. Further, the data did not explore some issues of importance to O’Donnell, such as why fathers of children in paternal kinship homes participated with casework services more than fathers of children in maternal kinship homes.</p>

<h3 id="data-available-from-social-agencies">Data Available From Social Agencies</h3>

<p>Virtually every social agency, school, and institutional setting collects an enormous amount of data on their clients. Often these data have great potential as resources for a needs assessment. For example, the client records of these organizations can be valuable in providing information about the demographic and diagnostic characteristics of clients, frequency of clients with different problems and different types of interventions that have been used to help them, the amount of time that clients have received services and, in some cases, outcome data for current and former clients.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of Using Agency Data</strong></p>

  <p>A study by Faithfull, Cook, and Lucas (2005) investigated the need for support services by patients with malignant brain tumors and their caregivers in a cancer and palliative care program These evaluators were interested in finding out which community support services clients were using. Data were drawn retrospectively from case notes and clinical records for a population of 1,254 patients referred     to the palliative care program over one year. Data collected from the records included demographic characteristics, extent of palliative care service use, other health and social service use, symptoms experienced, and time from diagnosis to referral and death. This evaluation identified some important clinical needs and questions for this specific client group related to palliative care. A critical question recommended for future investigations was what services the caregivers needed.  A limitation of the study was that it was not known how accurate the case notes and records were.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In another instance, a study was conducted of runaway and homeless lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth in New York City (Nolan, 2006). The agency wanted to find out what happened to the youths after they left a transitional living program, by using case files about them. The files included information on the youths discharged from the program over a five-year period. Information was taken from the files on demographic characteristics, preand posthousing status, preand posteducational status, foster-care history, abuse history, length of stay in</p>

<p>the transitional living program, and reason for discharge. The case files had an abundance of helpful data. For example, on the topic of abuse history, the study found that half the youth had reported experiencing physical abuse, and one third had reported being sexually abused, mostly by family members, boyfriends, and family friends. Half had reported experiencing verbal or emotional abuse, including homophobic and transgender-phobic remarks.</p>

<h3 id="mapping-resources">Mapping Resources</h3>

<p>Another recently developed approach uses computer and electronic files. Mapping visually locates specific groups or clusters of people or problems in specific geographic areas and helps users recognize where there are concentrations of problems. The concentrations can then be explored in terms of how they are associated with other characteristics, such as income level or ethnicity. For example, the U.S. Census tool, American Factfinder, can be used to select specific census data and map them across a geographic area of interest, such as a city or county. The tool, which allows for creating, viewing, printing, and downloading maps, is available online at American FactFinder (or https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). The Reference Maps tool can be used to view boundaries of census geographies, such as counties, cities and towns, urban areas, congressional districts, census tracts, and census blocks. The Thematic Maps tool can be used to view geographic patterns in census data. Thematic maps are available for the Census, the Economic Census, and the Population Estimates program. The tutorial “Creating and Using Maps” is available for guidance.
Thematic maps may be particularly helpful when you want to compare statis-
tical data of specific groups, such as median income, displayed in a map format. You can change the view of the thematic map by clicking on the area of the map you want to view in more detail or by selecting a new geography, theme, or data set. The Quick Tips command assists in navigating or customizing your map.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of Mapping as a Form of Assessment</strong></p>

  <p>A specific mapping program, referred to as a geographic information system (GIS) can help an evaluator gather more information about the characteristics of a local community, city, or county. The GIS can create maps for such things as the location of all senior centers, the degree to which neighborhoods are healthy, poverty levels in a community, locations of Medicaid users, crime rates, and specific agencies. More information can be found about the GIS program and its various features in the work of Hillier (2007).</p>

<h3 id="administer-a-questionnaire">Administer a Questionnaire</h3>

<p>A questionnaire is a frequently chosen method to obtain relevant data for a needs assessment. A questionnaire can be an excellent way to inquire about the needs of a target group on a specific topic, such as family planning, housing improvements, or social activities for seniors. The questionnaire could be mailed to the intended audience, hand-delivered door-to-door, or handed out at a meeting or community gathering (Dudley, 2011). An advantage of a questionnaire is that it can be distributed to a large group of people without much effort. However, the questionnaire needs to be constructed so that it is completely self-explanatory and simple enough to fill out, as an interviewer will not be present to clarify anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment Questionnaire</strong></p>

  <p>Using a questionnaire mailed to every  resident  of  the  neighborhood,  Line  (2007) used a community needs assessment to explore neighbors’ interest in several activities being considered by an expanding community center. First, respondents selected from a list of activities the ones that they believed their family members would likely participate in,  including  baseball,  T-ball,  volley ball, tennis, after-school programs, nature and bike trails, tutoring, senior social clubs, educational seminars, and concerts. Next, respondents were asked about their interests in specific classes, such as karate, CPR and first aid, self-defense,  arts and crafts, gardening, cooking, and safety. Then they were asked what methods they would prefer to receive information about upcoming park and recreation events. Options included monthly newsletters, flyers, public service announcements, e-mail, announcements in local newspapers, and information posted at the community center. Several questions followed  about  the  best  times for their availability, such as the best times for children’s activities (e.g., mornings, midday, afternoons, evenings, weekdays, or weekends). In addition, respondents were asked how they felt about existing activities at the center. On     a scale of 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied), questions included how much they felt that various existing activities met their needs and how satisfied they were with the community center generally. Finally, they were asked about their readiness to participate in new activities if they were provided (e.g., “Would you come to the center to preregister for these classes, and how much could you afford to pay for such classes?”). A final question asked if respondents wanted to    be contacted about a specific program interest and, if so, to list the program and their name and phone number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A disadvantage of questionnaires is that they almost always use quantitative methods and ask forced-response questions; this is because experience has shown that most respondents are not likely to answer more than one or two open-ended questions. Another disadvantage is that questionnaires usually have low response rates. This problem could be addressed by administering the questionnaire to people attending a social event and encouraging them to fill it out at the event, which can work especially well if either the evaluator or the organization sponsoring the event are known and trusted by the people asked to participate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples of Questions Used in a Domestic Violence Needs Assessment for the Victims</strong></p>

  <p>Stewart (2005) constructed the following questionnaire:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>How important is it for you to have information about domestic violence? (Circle 1 response.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Not important	Somewhat important		Very important</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How important is it for you to have a safe place to stay if there is an emergency? (Circle 1 response.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Not important	Somewhat important		Very important</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How important is it for you to attend a support group? (Circle 1 response.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Not important	Somewhat important		Very important</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How important is it for you to have help when you go to court? (Circle 1 response.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Not important	Somewhat important		Very important</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How important is it for you to have individual counseling? (Circle 1 response.)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Not important	Somewhat important		Very important</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous example from Stewart (2005) uses a forced-response question format and identifies a few of the questions used by a MSW student to assess the needs of victims of domestic violence. While the questions are effective for quickly finding out the degree to which respondents need each program area, qualitative questions could be added to gain insight into how their specific needs are manifested and how respondents might use such a set of services if available.</p>

<p>Another way to structure a needs assessment in an agency that serves victims of domestic violence is to focus on the victims’ knowledge of what constitutes domestic violence and how it should be addressed. Examples of some of the types of questions that could be asked are the following (Women’s Commission, 2005).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Multiple-Choice Question</strong></p>

  <p>Domestic violence affects</p>

  <p>(a)	Only children who observe the violence in their home.</p>

  <p>(b)	All children living in homes with domestic violence.</p>

  <p>(c)	Only teenagers.</p>

  <p>(d)	Only young children.</p>

  <p>(e)	Does not affect children.</p>

  <p>[Correct answer is b]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>True/False Questions</strong></p>

  <p>Domestic violence only occurs in low-income families.</p>

  <p>(a)	True</p>

  <p>(b)	False</p>

  <p>[Correct answer is false]</p>

  <p>A batterer is never nice to his/her partner.</p>

  <p>(a)	True</p>

  <p>(b)	False</p>

  <p>[Correct answer is false]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Questionnaires for informants to fill out could also be implemented, particularly if there are experts with special knowledge on a topic and who are well acquainted with the needs of the community. Informants can share their own and others’ perspectives. Informants might be professionals or volunteers in counseling or advocacy programs or teachers, administrators, or others who have frequent contact with a population of interest. Their expertise would be based largely on their familiarity with the population.</p>

<h3 id="conduct-interviews">Conduct Interviews</h3>

<p>Interviews are also a good choice for conducting needs assessments. An interview can be conducted somewhat like a questionnaire. Because an interview takes more time to administer than a questionnaire and requires training of the interviewer, interviews likely focus on a smaller group of respondents (Dudley, 2011). Yet, an advantage of interviews is that the interviewer can probe more deeply to elicit the views, attitudes, and needs of interviewees, which can result in valuable qualitative data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eliminating Health and Social Disparities: Some Policy Interview Questions</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>What role do you think your agency can play in community-based efforts to eliminate health and human service disparities?</li>
    <li>What does it take for agencies to be effective in eliminating disparities in the community?</li>
    <li>What other resources exist in the community aimed at eliminating disparities? How can these resources be strengthened?</li>
    <li>What goals do you think need to be measured to determine whether the community is making progress in increasing access to services and reducing health and social disparities?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Informant interviews are a specific type of interviewing approach to consider, particularly if there are experts with special knowledge and who are well acquainted with the needs of the community. The informants can share not only their own perspectives but also those of others who may be more difficult to reach. Informants could be civic leaders, gang leaders or former leaders, representatives of advocacy groups, teachers with extensive experience in the community, volunteers and staff members of community agencies, and others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of Informant Interviews</strong></p>

  <p>Williams (2006), an MSW student, conducted a needs assessment inquiry of staff members of a crisis intervention unit of a family agency. This agency provides shelter, case management, counseling, and advocacy services to victims of domestic violence or sexual assaults. The purpose of the interview was to find    out from informants what additional programs they felt were needed for those experiencing domestic violence. The results of the needs assessment ranked support groups and transitional housing as the most  important  missing programs. The study also revealed that the family agency sponsoring the crisis intervention should advertise its services more, as many people were not familiar with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Case studies and other in-depth interviews with a few people are another way to conduct a needs assessment. Case descriptions can be very useful in determining the need for a program by providing a fuller understanding of someone’s circumstances and experiences. By illuminating the complexities of the social circumstances faced by one or a few prospective clients or client families, for example, case studies can provide insights that may be relevant to understanding their struggles and resilience as well as how to help them.</p>

<p>The professional literature provides many examples of case studies that have focused on a few individuals or on a larger social system such as a cultural group, gang, or social system such as a mental hospital or prison. These studies have often been enormously helpful in providing new insights into the lives of a specific group not previously understood or known in society and in discovering new ways to effectively address unmet needs. Goffman’s (1961) classic book, Asylums, is a case study of a mental hospital in the 1950s. In this case, his study was a catalyst for beginning the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s, which led to the creation of a whole new system of community-based residential and vocational programs for people with mental illness and mental retardation intended to replace programs that had been provided in institutional settings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Case Study of Life in a Mental Hospital</strong></p>

  <p>Erving Goffman (1961) conducted a two-year case study of a large state mental institution reported in a book titled Asylums. In Asylums, Goffman vividly depicts what life was like in this institution and how the patients were regimented into a rigid, imposed schedule. The case description was most effective in conveying how the institution was harmful and counterproductive to patients. The book was timely and served as a strong catalyst for the deinstitutionalization movement initiated a few years later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A case description of an undocumented family of immigrants from Mexico could also provide valuable insights about the numerous difficulties they face. Using an in-depth interview approach with one family, an interviewer could obtain information about the difficulties that recently arrived families face in the United States and programs that could be developed to help them. Possible problems that could be more fully understood through a case study approach include how to receive adequate medical care, find adequate housing, enroll children in day care and public schools, find transportation, get help if exploited on the job, and obtain legal assistance.</p>

<p>In-depth interviews with a sample of staff members of different local agencies with similar client profiles are another way to proceed with a needs assessment. Often social workers and others on the front line have a wealth of information from their daily contact with clients. Tapping into this wealth of information can be a valuable data source for a needs assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Examples of Other Needs Assessments of MSW Students</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Residents of an older-adult assisted-living center were assessed based on the importance of their spiritual beliefs and practices (Franco, 2004). A major intent of the study was to explore the need for additional programs to address residents’ spiritual needs. Ten residents were interviewed with such questions as, do you belong to an organized religious group? What spiritual practices do you use? How important is prayer or meditation to you? What do you think happens after death? How can the center provide more assistance to you in response to your spiritual needs?</li>
    <li>In exploring the need for a new program for Latino children who had witnessed domestic violence, Wolochwianski (2005) administered a questionnaire for mothers who had been victims of domestic violence about their children. The simple questionnaire asked whether they had any children, their ages and sex, and whether they would be interested in their children receiving services for witnessing domestic violence. Further, questions were asked about the best times for such services, convenient locations to meet, and whether help would be needed with transportation.</li>
    <li>Caliento (2004), whose field placement was in a foster-care agency, assessed the need for a specific program for teen mothers in foster care. She asked the professionals serving the teens to fill out a structured questionnaire using a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). She asked them to rate the mothers based on their needs for parenting-skills training, one-on-one in-home support, education for preventing further pregnancies, child-care services for the baby, and using other existing programs offered by the agency.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The number and variety of possibilities for conducting a needs assessment with either a questionnaire or an interview method are almost endless.</p>

<h3 id="conduct-focus-groups">Conduct Focus Groups</h3>

<p>Focus groups are a special form of group interview in which participants are invited to discuss a specific topic, for example, the needs of African Americans for hospice care. Focus groups can be used to find out the views of several people on an issue of importance to a needs assessment. Members of focus groups are usually selected because they have personal knowledge about or expertise in a topic. The leader of a focus group facilitates a group discussion by asking members several general questions on the topic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Needs Assessment Using Focus Groups</strong></p>

  <p>The United Way of Central Carolinas (2011) conducted a needs assessment focusing on eliminating disparities in social  services.  To  “put  its  arms  around” the complexity of the disparities issue, the group solicited  input  from  the  broader community. It convened thirteen “learning conversations” with community  members  and  service  providers   to   better   understand   disparities   and to identify strategies in practice to eliminate them. They also facilitated problem analysis sessions with community stakeholders to answer three basic questions: What are the precursors  to  disparities? What  are  the  consequences of not addressing them? and Where can we as a community most appropriately intervene?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="arrange-community-and-public-forums">Arrange Community and Public Forums</h3>

<p>Community forums are like focus groups in that an open selection process is used to bring people together to discuss a topic of interest to all of them, such as new or improved housing or fighting crime. This open selection process can be a special invitation to selected members of the community or a more open invitation to the entire community with a public announcement informing people of the upcoming community forum and its purpose. Participants are likely to belong to the same community or neighborhood, and the topic is likely to focus on an issue that has broad implications that affect large numbers of people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Community Forum on the Growing Mortgage Foreclosure Rate</strong></p>

  <p>The local newspaper wrote a series of articles on the growing rate of foreclosure among homeowners, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods. After that, a housing assistance agency decided to pursue this need further in one of these neighborhoods. It held a community forum to openly discuss the problem and to determine the extent to which it was a concern of residents. Along with a presentation of the results of the newspaper series and an open discussion of the problem, agency personnel handed out a confidential  questionnaire  on  foreclosures  for affected residents to fill out about themselves or close friends. Some of the questions asked were the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What kinds of loans did you/they purchase?</li>
    <li>What were the interest rates and other charges in the mortgages?</li>
    <li>Did you/they feel that the rates were unusually high or unfair?</li>
    <li>How much down payment was required?</li>
    <li>What circumstances led to the foreclosures for individual families?</li>
    <li>What kinds of help do they want?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>Observations are another approach for assessing the need for a program. Social workers regularly depend on their observational skills in practice, such as when visiting clients in their homes. The nonverbal communication of clients, for example, is often considered as important as their verbal communication. Observational evaluations use all the senses, particularly sight and hearing, to collect data about a program and the needs it intends to address. Observations focus on what can be seen or heard from people. Behavior includes any number of things, such as a verbal comment or nonverbal expression, a conversation between two or more people, body movements, and physical contact between people.</p>

<p>Windshield surveys are one form of observation in which an individual new to a neighborhood drives through it to gain information (Shuster &amp; Goeppinger, 1996). A windshield survey is usually structured such that the observers know what they are looking for. Usually these observations focus on the physical aspects of a neighborhood, such as types of housing, physical conditions of housing, street conditions, location of bus stops, commercial entities, people and their activities, and other observable characteristics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Some Guidelines for a Windshield Tour of an Agency’s Neighborhood
**
Kelly Koney (consultant to Council for Children’s Rights, Charlotte, NC, personal communication, 2002) provides the following guidelines for a windshield tour:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Keep your observations objective.</li>
    <li>Observe what can influence how a client uses the agency’s services.</li>
    <li>Is there a nearby bus stop?</li>
    <li>Is there an easily accessible parking lot?</li>
    <li>How safe is it to walk around?</li>
    <li>Is this an affluent neighborhood that may intimidate some lower-income people?</li>
    <li>Is the agency located in a residential neighborhood? Are there mostly houses, apartments, or businesses? What are the conditions of the buildings, streets, sidewalks?</li>
    <li>What types of people are out? What are they doing? What are their facial expressions toward you and others?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>An important variation in observation studies is whether the evaluator participates in the activities or events being observed. Sometimes participant observation is used, which is unstructured observation involving the evaluator as a participant. A participant-observer role helps the evaluator become more of an insider who observes people and their social context without drawing excessive attention to his or her presence. Participant observers are likely to use unstructured interviewing methods and unstructured observations in their data collection (e.g., Patton, 1987).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Needs Assessment Using Participant Observation</strong></p>

  <p>An MSW student (Jordan, 2005) wanted to evaluate the extent to which collaboration occurred in decision-making of teams of collaborative agencies meeting at a child advocacy center. She used the participant-observation method to collect data on the leadership styles of team leaders and the activities evident in the team meetings. She chose to observe a random sample of teams discussing client cases. Her observations were partially structured using an existing construct of leadership. Leadership style was defined and measured as being one of four different types: telling, selling, participating, or delegating (Hersey &amp; Blanchard, 1977). Participating and delegating styles reflected a more collaborative leadership style. Jordan’s thesis was that the leadership styles were related to such activities as the number of information disclosures, number of team agreements toward action steps, and the number of team recommendations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One evaluator took on a participant-observation role in a needs assessment of the stigma problems of people with a mental retardation label. Their stigma problems were partially revealed in several activities that he participated in with these participants once they informed him of their comfort with his presence (Dudley, 1983). The activities provided first-hand exposure to some of their stigma problems embedded in various social situations; it also facilitated more open sharing of reports of stigma problems with the evaluator. These activities were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dancing with the people being studied.</li>
  <li>Eating with them at restaurants.</li>
  <li>Riding public transportation with them.</li>
  <li>Joining them for visits at their home.</li>
  <li>Sitting with them at their workstation at a sheltered workshop.</li>
  <li>Double-dating.</li>
  <li>Talking with them or listening to their conversations at various social occasions.</li>
</ul>

<p>An important caveat for the participant observer is to minimize or avoid any interference with the behaviors being observed. This requires a balance between being able to participate enough to become an insider but not so much as to create unnecessary reactivity. A drawback to participant observation is that it takes a much greater amount of time to build rapport and to gain acceptance from those being observed before fully concentrating on data collection. This initial period is a time in which such things as informed consent issues and the evaluator’s role can be clarified and supported. This method also usually takes additional time during the data collection period to obtain a saturation of types of behaviors that reflect the many possible variations that could be key to a special area of need. In the previous example on stigma, it is evident that observations occurred during a variety of activities to obtain a saturation of various types of stigma expressed with a wide range of familiar people and strangers in several different social situations.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-combination-of-approaches">Using a Combination of Approaches</h3>

<p>Many needs assessments use multiple methods of data collection to capture a picture of a community from several different perspectives and formats. Multimethod needs assessments are the best approach for producing the most accurate assessment. For example, two or more data sources can be compared or a source of qualitative data can supplement a quantitative source. Considering the variety of approaches described previously, a comprehensive needs assessment could, for example, involve obtaining demographic data from the U.S. Census or from a local health department, administering a questionnaire to the population of interest, observing discussions at neighborhood meetings, and carrying out informal interviews with both the people of interest and professionals from social agencies in the area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Multi-method Needs Assessment</strong></p>

  <p>Hymans (2000) reported on a multi method study in which BSW and nursing students joined together to complete a comprehensive community-wide assessment of a local neighborhood as part of a macro practice course. The goals of the project included assessing how a community functions, developing a broader understanding of social work practice, and providing a service to a community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The students used several data collection methods, including interviews with key informants, observations of neighborhood meetings, gathering existing demographic data, reviewing official documents, using mapping tools, conversations with political and religious leaders, and networking with professionals in the area.</p>

<h2 id="needs-assessments-and-practice-interventions">NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND PRACTICE INTERVENTIONS</h2>

<p>Although needs assessments are mostly used to plan new programs, they can also be used to plan new or expanded practice interventions. Needs assessments at the practice level can have some of the same purposes and benefits as programs. For example, needs assessments can help in planning new practice interventions by providing information on clients’ needs, their perceptions of their needs and prior experiences in addressing them, and their thoughts on how helpful a proposed practice approach can be to them.</p>

<p>Needs-assessment information can also be helpful in investigating any accessibility barriers for a new practice intervention. A most effective way to learn more about accessibility barriers is to explore this issue with prospective clients. Psychological and cultural accessibility may be the largest accessibility barriers to confront. In this regard, a needs assessment can uncover whether a new practice intervention comprises goals, techniques, and lines of questioning that are sensitive to and compatible with the cultural beliefs of some groups. For example, a practice approach intended to help clients gain new insights into their problems may not be as practical or even relevant to some groups as a training approach that stresses learning new skills.</p>

<p>Similarly, a needs assessment can be a vehicle for learning more about how to craft goals and objectives for a new or expanded practice interventions. Goals crafted from the provider’s perspective may need to be cross-checked by the perspectives of potential recipients. Asking recipients questions about proposed goals and objectives of a practice intervention such as the following may help:</p>

<ol>

<p>Assessments conducted for proposed practice interventions, like those conducted for new programs, have several methodological options at their disposal. They can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative methods can include in-depth interviews with clients, minimally structured observations, and brief questionnaires with open-ended questions. Pertinent qualitative data for a needs assessment can also be drawn from existing client records and client journals. Family genograms and ecomaps can also be used as assessment tools and can provide visual descriptions of family relationships and their connections to external social systems.</p>

<p>Quantitative needs assessments, such as standardized scales, can also be used in developing practice interventions intended to address specific types of problems. These scales can be used to assess a wide range of needs and issues, such as selfesteem, depression, addictions, family well-being, and other complex and multidimensional variables. Several sources of standardized scales are available in social work and related literature (e.g., Fischer &amp; Corcoran, 1994; Ginsberg, 2001; Jordan &amp; Franklin, 2015; Royse, Thyer, &amp; Padgett, 2016). These scales should have strong validity and reliability. Questionnaires and interviews developed by experienced practitioners are other quantitative tools that can be used.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example of a Standardized Scale Used in Assessments of Practice</strong></p>

  <p>One agency used an anger evaluation scale as a needs-assessment tool in developing a new group approach. This scale helped adolescent clients focus on discussing goals and objectives in the problem area of their behavior (Patrick &amp; Rich, 2004). The individual items of the scale were used to facilitate discussions with clients about the many ramifications and variations in expressions of dysfunctional anger. They also used the scale as a baseline measure of the clients’ dysfunctional anger and as an ongoing measure of their anger at different points in their work together. The anger evaluation scale consisted of ten statements on anger using a five-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree). Examples of scale items are the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I often get angrier than necessary.</li>
    <li>I usually stay angry for hours.</li>
    <li>Because of my anger, I use threatening language or gestures.</li>
    <li>I use alcohol or drugs to calm my rage.</li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-how-to-conduct-a-needs-assessment">SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO CONDUCT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT</h2>

<p>A needs assessment should involve the participation of the stakeholders, if possible, so that its results will be well received by them. Several steps are important to consider that focus primarily on involving stakeholders from the beginning and incorporating them into each step to the extent possible. Keep in mind the participatory action approach, described in Chapter 2, as one set of guidelines to follow. Other resources provide additional suggestions on these steps. For example, Meenaghan, Kilty, and McNutt (2004) offer the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a broad-based committee or team to sponsor the assessment. Attempt to include all actual and potential stakeholders. Make sure that they represent the varying views of their constituencies, including different views and experiences on how the program or practice intervention should look.</li>
  <li>Have an extensive discussion with the committee about the pertinent agency policies and the general intent of a proposed program or practice intervention. General intent can include identifying target groups of clients that you wish to help, general goals for helping them and their families, and initial assumptions about the causes of their problems and possible solutions.</li>
  <li>Explore funding support for your project and incorporate the ideas of potential funding agencies in your continued articulation of the problem and goals of your project. Also, begin articulating a proposal for obtaining funds. Possible funding supports could be identified early in the process in a more general way.</li>
  <li>Decide on the methods that you will use to conduct your own needs assessment. This is often a first-hand, in-depth study of the community. Possible methods to consider are focus groups, informant interviews, interviews of a sample of prospective recipients, and interviews with relevant agency personnel. Decide whether you need either a professional firm or an individual consultant to help develop your research methodologies.</li>
  <li>Conduct your needs assessment and compile an easy-to-read report of your findings for your stakeholder committee.</li>
  <li>Involve all stakeholders in your committee in articulating a proposal for a new program or practice intervention. Develop the proposal by supplementing and revising any earlier versions of your problem definition and goals based on your needs assessment results. Then develop a set of general strategies and specific program or practice components that you could implement to achieve your goals.</li>
  <li>Be sure to consider program or practice interventions at various levels in your general strategies. These could include individual and family services to prospective recipients, group services, community education efforts, advocacy, and new agency policy initiatives that would directly or indirectly support your new program.</li>
</ol>

<p>The preceding steps are designed especially for a needs assessment of an at-risk group in a city or county. This general outline has been used to conduct a needs assessment of one at-risk group and could be used with other at-risk populations as well, such as teenage mothers with their first baby, recent immigrants from Mexico or Central America, cancer survivors, homeless people without access to adequate housing, and socially isolated elderly lesbian women.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Steps in a Needs Assessment of Caregivers</strong></p>

  <p>An evaluation group conducting a needs assessment  of  family  caregivers  of  older adults defined its own steps for conducting a needs assessment (Kietzman, Scharlach, &amp; Dal Santo, 2004).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Describe the current population of caregivers by compiling a descriptive profile.</li>
    <li>Determine the existing and unmet needs of caregivers by obtaining input from &gt;
professionals, consumers, and advocates.</li>
    <li>Inventory existing caregiver resources and services by identifying all programs and services already serving caregivers.</li>
    <li>Identify service gaps including existing barriers to equitable access to caregiver resources and services by assessing what the gaps and barriers are.</li>
    <li>Prioritize the identified service needs of caregivers by synthesizing information gathered and ranking the needs.</li>
    <li>Design a plan for the delivery of caregiver services that reduces identified barriers to access, supplements existing services, and creates new services where none exist, in the most effective and efficient manner possible by implementing a decision-making process that results in a plan of action.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>As an exercise, attempt to answer the following questions. Who might be some of the unnamed stakeholders, in general terms, in Kietzman et al.’s (2004) project? How do you think these stakeholders could become more involved in conducting their needs assessment? What would be some of the advantages and disadvantages of adding the participatory action research steps to their needs assessment?</p>

<p>The next chapter considers another important evaluation topic during the planning stage: crafting goals and measurable objectives. It is important to carefully craft goals and objectives before implementing a new program or practice intervention.</p>

<h2 id="summary">SUMMARY</h2>

<p>An important overall task during the planning stage is determining whether there is a need for a new program or practice intervention. Typically, this involves conducting a needs assessment. A needs assessment is an organized, systematic effort to assess the need for something, in this case the need for a new program or practice intervention. Needs assessments are important in documenting not only the need for a new intervention; also, needs assessments are appropriate for determining the adequacy of existing programs and existing informal resources, detecting barriers to client accessibility to services, and assisting in crafting goals and measurable objectives for a program. Several methods for conducting a needs assessment are described in the chapter. They include using existing data from many sources, administering a questionnaire, conducting interviews, conducting focus groups, arranging community and public forums, and observation. Often two or more of these methods are used in combination to complete a needs assessment that is more comprehensive and accurate. Among the important specific tasks to be addressed during the planning stage that are covered in the chapter include determining who the prospective clients will be, as well as defining their problems, needs, and the underlying causes.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-questions-and-assignments">DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Use the logic model to design a program for older adults who have lost their spouses and are socially isolated, have some chronic medical problems affecting their mobility, and live in multicultural neighborhoods. Begin by finding a needs assessment article or report that identifies some of the needs for such a population. Then brainstorm with classmates or other colleagues to identify some ways to meet these interpersonal and mobility needs. Describe a proposed program that addresses many of the needs so that the adults can maintain their independence and natural supports in their neighborhoods.</li>
  <li>This is a project for two or more students to complete. Focus on the needs of families in a community that you choose. Conduct an informal, multifaceted needs assessment of families in a community and the resources that already exist to help them. This assignment is partially intended to help you integrate work at several different system levels, especially using family and community assessments. Specific suggestions for carrying out this assignment are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>Attempt to talk with a variety of parents and other adult family members in the community, asking them what they think are the critical needs and problems that families and family members face. Ask for their opinions on how these needs can be met. Also, what types of resources and services are needed, and how can social workers help them overcome the problems they identify? Be sure to explain to them your purpose and your intention to keep all information that they share confidential.</li>
      <li>Consider observing what is happening with the family members (e.g., parents, grandparents, children, teenagers, and babies) that you see. What are they doing, what does their affect seem to communicate, what strengths do they appear to have, and what problems and needs seem evident through your observations?</li>
      <li>If you have difficulty talking with parents and other adult family members because they are unwilling or hesitant, identify and talk with advocates of families in the community, such as community leaders, volunteers, teachers, agency personnel, and other informal leaders.</li>
      <li>Look at the findings of any recently conducted local studies that might reveal something about the needs of families. Consider newspaper articles and community hearings. Explore citywide and countywide studies and the U.S. Census if they offer data that pertain to your specific community.</li>
      <li>Think about and share other ways to learn about the needs of families in the community. Thinking outside of the box is often overlooked in doing an assessment like this.</li>
      <li>After assessing the needs of families, identify and locate social agencies, community centers, churches, schools, day-care centers, businesses, and other organizations in the community and find out how they are attempting to help families or individual family members.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Using data from the U.S. Census, investigate the needs of children under five years of age in your community. This can be done online at www.census.gov. Select one report and describe what you learned about their needs.</li>
  <li>Conduct a windshield tour of the neighborhood surrounding your agency or another neighborhood where a large concentration of your clients lives. Use the suggestions on windshield tours in this chapter to help you conduct the assessment. Then share what you learned with the class or agency colleagues.</li>
  <li>Conduct a needs assessment using the American Factfinder mapping tool available at the U.S. Census website (American FactFinder, or https://factfinder.census. gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). Use the Thematic Maps tool to view some of the geographic patterns in the census data. Select a city or county of interest to you, identify a data set of the census, and create a map that visually displays data for the city or county.</li>
  <li>Work in small groups of three to five to complete this project (which can be carried out in conjunction with a policy course and is a variation of an exercise that appeared on the Baccalaureate Social Work Program Directors discussion list).
    <ul>
      <li>Select a community and identify a policy question that highlights an apparent unaddressed need (e.g., Do children need somewhere to go after school? Do teens need something to keep them off the street? Is a domestic violence hotline needed in the community?). You may want to seek assistance in identifying your policy issue from local social agencies or funding agencies.</li>
      <li>Once you have identified a policy question, conduct a needs assessment of the local community that provides data to tentatively confirm or refute your initial policy position. One of the questions of your needs assessment can be the policy question that you identified. Other questions can be used to document the suspected need(s) that you have identified.</li>
      <li>Write a policy change proposal that can address the needs that you have begun to document. Your proposal should include the following:
        <ol>
          <li>What is the unmet policy reform that is needed?</li>
          <li>How did you discover and document it?</li>
          <li>What do you propose to do to meet this need?</li>
          <li>How can it lead to advocacy for social justice issues?</li>
          <li>Where will you get funding?</li>
          <li>How will you secure other resources (e.g., space, materials)?</li>
          <li>Who will be your staff and volunteers? How will they be paid?</li>
          <li>How will they be recruited and trained?</li>
          <li>What will be your budget?</li>
          <li>What are the limitations or obstacles to implementing your plan? How might these obstacles be overcome?</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>A reaction paper of one or two pages can also be requested from each group member reflecting on such questions as, What was difficult? What was fun? What did you learn about the field of policy reform and community-based social work?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
