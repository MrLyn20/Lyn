<h1>Chapter 3 The Role of Ethics in Evaluations</h1>

<p class="view">by JAMES R. DUDLEY</p>

<h1 id="chapter-3-the-role-of-ethics-in-evaluations"><strong>CHAPTER 3: The Role of Ethics in Evaluations</strong></h1>

<p><em>What are our ethical obligations as evaluators?</em></p>

<p>Ethics plays a crucial role in both program and practice evaluations. This chapter describes the most important ethical issues to consider when conducting or negotiating evaluations. Because much of this material is largely a review of the ethics material covered in a basic research methods course, it is condensed here. A research methods text can be a helpful supplement to this chapter for those who want more information on ethics (e.g., Dudley, 2011; Marlow, 2011).</p>

<p>This chapter primarily highlights the ethical standards of three professional associations: the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), and the American Evaluation Association (AEA). Because social workers have many roles and functions and evaluation is only one of them, it is useful to consult the ethical code of an AEA, a professional organization that is completely made up of evaluators and focuses exclusively on evaluation activities. AEA represents several professions including social work.</p>

<p>The social work profession itself is rooted in a set of six basic core values that we should always try to remember (NASW, 2017). These core values have been adopted throughout the profession’s history and provide the foundation of social work’s unique purpose and perspective. The values are as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Service</li>
  <li>Social justice</li>
  <li>Dignity and worth of the person</li>
  <li>Importance of human relationships</li>
  <li>Integrity</li>
  <li>Competence</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Service</strong> is essentially the essence of what social workers do. We provide services to our clients with the intent of helping them. We need to continually keep in mind that evaluation is one of the services that we provide. These services benefit our clients, their agency providers, and the funding organizations that pay for these services.</p>

<p><strong>Evaluation</strong> is a service that provides important and often essential information to these groups about the nature and extent of services being offered, how well these services are addressing the needs of clients, and whether they are effective in helping clients. We must continually keep in mind that evaluations are not an optional service that can be ignored or disregarded; it is essential to the success of programs and practice interventions.</p>

<p><strong>Social justice</strong> is viewed by many as one of the major goals of evaluations. Evaluations ask if social justice work is evident in the services that are provided? Are they provided in the social problem areas that are most important to clients and their communities? Further, are the services providing solutions to people’s problems? Social problems can include among other things hunger, medical diseases and illnesses, disempowerment of people with mental health issues and disabilities, disenfranchisement in voting, unsatisfactory housing, unemployment and under employment, poverty, racial discrimination, and classism.</p>

<p><strong>The dignity and worth of the person</strong> are essential to promote in the evaluation world. Whatever we do as evaluators, we must always treat the people we evaluate with dignity and worth. Evaluations are intended to be a means of giving our clients more dignity because we care about what happens to them especially through the agencies that are helping them. Dignity is to be a priority to communicate to clients from our first contact to the last. Clients are to be treated with utmost respect, not as second-class citizens or people who deserve less because of who they are or what they may have done in the past. In addition, evaluation proposals and designs are expected to treat clients with the utmost dignity and respect including protection from any harm. Evaluation designs that might compromise a client’s rights or their physical or emotional well-being are to be avoided. As an example, an experimental design with a control group that prevents clients from receiving the help they need in a timely matter is unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Human relationships</strong> are the primary focus of social work. Therefore, human relationships are the focus of evaluations as well. While social workers sometimes provide goods as well as services, services are the primary provisions. We offer ourselves and our professional skills as the primary means of helping others improve their lives. Our relationships with our clients therefore are of utmost importance. In specific terms, our professional skills are central to helping people whether they be skills used in problem-solving, listening, expressing empathy, assessing client needs, helping clients identify their strengths, or strengthening their support network. Professional skills are also important in offering suggestions, instilling hope, encouraging positive outcomes, and empowering clients in numerous other ways. The focus of evaluations is also on human relationships as evaluations investigate how effective social workers are in using their professional skills to help clients meet their goals.</p>

<p><strong>Social work integrity</strong> is always expected to be at the center of what we are and do. We are expected to be honest, responsible, and reliable in all the ways we help, and we should always attempt to give our clients the highest quality of service that is possible. Nothing less should be considered. Evaluators are also expected to be people of integrity. Evaluators are involved because they want the services provided to clients to be effective in helping them. Specifically, evaluators are expected to initially explain to clients what they will be doing using an informed consent protocol, and evaluators are expected to follow through with what they propose. As an example, if an evaluator promises the participants of a study that they will provide them with helpful findings once an evaluation is completed, then they are expected to do this without questions or excuses.</p>

<p>The <strong>competence</strong> of social workers is also extremely important both for social workers that provide services to clients and evaluators as well. Evaluators are expected to have formal training and prior evaluation experience so that they can develop a meaningful and relevant evaluation proposal as well as implement it. They also need to have the competence in completing a final report that is accurate and beneficial to all the stakeholders. Agencies that evaluate programs are expected to hire evaluators outside their agency if there is no one available and qualified within the agency.</p>

<p>The AEA (2018) requires similar values for their members who conduct evaluations. Five overall principles are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong>   <strong>Systematic inquiry</strong>: Evaluators conduct data-based inquiries that are thorough, methodical, and contextually relevant.</p>

<p><strong>B.</strong>   <strong>Competence</strong>: Evaluators provide skilled professional services to stakeholders.</p>

<p><strong>C.</strong>   <strong>Integrity</strong>: Evaluators behave with honesty and transparency in order to ensure the integrity of the evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>D.</strong>   <strong>Respect for people</strong>: Evaluators honor the dignity, well-being, and self-worth of individuals and acknowledge the influence of culture within and across groups.</p>

<p><strong>E.</strong>   <strong>Common good and equity</strong>: Evaluators strive to contribute to the common good and advancement of an equitable and just society.</p>

<h2 id="1-ethics-for-conducting-evaluations"><strong>1. ETHICS FOR CONDUCTING EVALUATIONS</strong></h2>

<p>The NASW (2017) Code of Ethics devotes an entire section exclusively to social workers’ ethical obligations in research and evaluation activities. Section 5.02, titled “Evaluation and Research,” can be found at the NASW’s website under Code of Ethics (see www.naswdc.org). Some of the section’s specific principles are reviewed in the following discussion along with some of the AEA principles.</p>

<h3 id="11-promote-and-facilitate-evaluations-and-research"><strong>1.1 Promote and Facilitate Evaluations and Research</strong></h3>

<p>This introductory statement of Section 5.02(b) of the NASW (2017) Code of Ethics reminds social workers that they have an ethical obligation to promote and facilitate evaluation studies and other types of research. This suggests that social workers should be supportive of others who conduct evaluations in their employment agencies. However, to do this, they need to be familiar with the ethical standards of research and other ethical standards of social work so that they can become gatekeepers, both to encourage new evaluations that meet the ethical standards of the profession and to discourage evaluations that do not.</p>

<h3 id="12-consult-appropriate-institutional-review-boards"><strong>1.2 Consult Appropriate Institutional Review Boards</strong></h3>

<p>Institutional review boards (IRBs) are groups of people at an institution who have been designated to promulgate ethical standards and to approve and monitor the ethical provisions of all studies sponsored by the institution. Virtually all universities and governmental agencies have an IRB. Evaluators and other researchers are required to submit a formal statement to the IRB that describes their study, its procedures, its benefits, and how it protects research participants from risks of harm and invasion of privacy (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02 ). In addition, IRBs can serve as training centers to inform researchers of specific requirements of informed consent.</p>

<p>Many social agencies also have an IRB, an ethics committee, or they can create a similar ad hoc group when it is needed. Social agencies that sponsor research and do not have such a group should institute a formal way to establish ethical standards and procedures, to protect research participants, and to prevent ethical problems. Using the guidelines herein, you can create a new structure for your agency so that it can carefully review any new studies before they are approved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Create Your Own IRB or Ethics Committee</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Select a group of five to seven agency staff members who represent different programs, disciplines, and positions in the agency.</li>
    <li>Orient the staff representatives to the ethical problems and safeguards that an IRB typically considers. Introduce them to the various functions of an IRB. Ask experts on these subjects from other agencies and institutions to speak about them to your new IRB members.</li>
    <li>Role-play three or four typical scenarios involving evaluation studies that have ethical omissions or problems.</li>
    <li>When reviewing the first two or three cases, step back and examine the process that you used in arriving at your decisions as well as the decisions themselves. You may also want to ask a more experienced IRB or ethics committee to review your deliberations and decisions.</li>
    <li>Consider combining your IRB with a human rights committee if you have one. However, be sure to distinguish how the review process for approving an evaluation and the process of reviewing a client human rights case are different.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the IRB or ethics committee is formally accountable to someone in the agency in an authority role, such as the executive director or an assistant director. Make sure this person is assigned with the responsibility for overseeing the training and operation of the committee and has a budget necessary to meet its resource needs.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="13conduct-your-own-evaluations"><strong>1.3Conduct Your Own Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>The NASW Code also encourages social workers to conduct their own evaluations within agencies or to assist others in doing so (NASW, 2017, Sections 5.02). Social workers are encouraged to “monitor and evaluate policies, the implementation of programs, and practice interventions.”</p>

<p>At this point, you may have questions, such as, “What if I don’t have an interest in conducting evaluation studies?” The Code of Ethics (NASW, 2017) encourages everyone to participate in evaluation studies. If social workers do not, the concern is that evaluations conducted without their input and leadership will likely overlook the perspectives and experiences they have deriving from direct contact with clients. The NASW Code also states, “Social workers should critically examine and keep current with emerging knowledge relevant to social work and fully use evaluation and research evidence in their professional practice.” This is an ultimate reason for social workers to both support and facilitate evaluation studies by others and to conduct our own evaluations. We have an ethical obligation to learn about the most up-to date knowledge and skills available in our specific fields of practice to maximize the likelihood that our interventions are as effective as they can be.</p>

<h3 id="14-protect-participants-of-evaluation-studies"><strong>1.4 Protect Participants of Evaluation Studies</strong></h3>

<p>The NASW (2017) code states that it is essential that we protect the research participants, who are usually our clients, from any adverse consequences of an evaluation study (Section 5.02). Such problems often occur inadvertently because the evaluator has not given enough forethought to consequences or the evaluator may have decided that the potential contributions from a study outweigh the potential problems that participants experience.</p>

<p>Several types of ethical problems could adversely affect participants of a study, including physical harm, psychological harm, invasion of privacy, or deception. There have been many studies known to harm participants. The Tuskegee Institute Study, conducted in the 1930s to determine the adverse effects of untreated syphilis, is a classic example. In that study, African American men were deliberately deceived, and effective treatment was deliberately withheld. By the time the study’s ethical violations were exposed, twenty-eight men had died from syphilis, one hundred others had died of related complications, at least forty of the men’s wives were infected, and nineteen of their children had contracted the disease at birth.</p>

<p>Although such studies are no longer conducted in the United States (thanks to regulations enacted by governmental agencies, universities, and other groups), evaluation studies can still result in physical harm today, even if that harm is not as horrific as in the Tuskegee Institute Study. Examples of harm include asking vulnerable people unnecessary sensitive questions or withholding essential services from a client assigned to a control group.</p>

<p>Some evaluation studies also have the potential to cause psychological harm. Although psychological harm is likely to be less tangible and more difficult to detect than physical harm, it can have an equally damaging impact on participants.</p>

<p>Evaluations can cause psychological harm, for example, by investigating how children or adolescents have been adversely affected by sexually abusive experiences or by exploring the dreams of someone with psychosis. Bringing up such emotionally charged issues without also helping such participants resolve them is unethical and can be harmful to the participants. The issues around psychological harm are complicated as the harm can manifest immediately after participation in a study or several months or years later.</p>

<p>Evaluation studies can also unnecessarily invade participants’ privacy, and they are considered unethical if the possibility of such an invasion of privacy is not pointed out to participants and agreed upon to discuss beforehand. It is best to avoid such evaluations unless there is a strong justification to the contrary. People who have difficulty saying no to requests to participate in studies are among the most likely to be susceptible to invasion of privacy. Examples of evaluation study topics likely to invade some people’s privacy can be those that ask about alcohol or drug practices, sexual orientation, or clinical diagnoses. These evaluation topics can still be legitimate if participants provide informed consent, if support is made available to them during and after the study, and if there is adequate justification to explore these topics.</p>

<p>Deceiving a person into participating in an evaluation can also be harmful. Evaluators can have good reasons to deceive participants, such as minimizing a reactive effect from sharing too many details about the study’s purpose or hypotheses. Nevertheless, such deception still can have ethical implications. The <em>60 Minutes II</em> undercover episode described subsequently is an example of the administration and staff of a psychiatric facility being deceived. Yet the investigation led to the reform of a facility that was harming its patients. The dilemma embedded in the example is quite evident. Although the use of deception in such an investigation is wrong, so are unsound professional practices. A decision had to be made about whether the intent of the study and the deception involved outweighed the professional agency’s right to privacy. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong><em>An Example of Deception</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The former television news- magazine program 60 Minutes II hired a social worker as an undercover investigator to observe life in a psychiatric facility (O’Neill, 1999). The social worker concealed a videotape recorder in his shirt and a camera in his unusually thick eyeglasses while working as a mental health technician at a private psychiatric hospital. The CBS network was motivated to initiate the story after hearing of the death of a sixteen- year- old boy who had been restrained at a facility owned by the same company. The investigation documented many appalling conditions at the institution, including fraudulent and sometimes bogus case reporting, an understaffed facility, neglect in giving potentially dangerous drugs, and the restraint of juveniles by staff without training. After a public airing of the episode, two facilities owned by the company were closed. The episode also led to renewed activities by Congress and mental health advocates to monitor and reform options available for using restraints.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="15-obtain-voluntary-informed-consent-from-evaluation-participants"><strong>1.5 Obtain Voluntary Informed Consent From Evaluation Participants</strong></h3>

<p>An informed consent protocol can be designed to address many of the concerns raised about potential ethical problems of studies, including physical and psychological harm, invasion of privacy, and deception. Informed consent means that the participants of a study are thoroughly informed about the study before they consent or agree to participate (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). Evaluation participants should give informed consent before they are encouraged to participate in any study. The information provided with informed consent is to be clearly communicated and presented at the level of the participants’ understanding. It has been suggested that informed consent documentation be written at no higher than a sixth-grade reading level to ensure that it is simple enough to understand. Several types of information should be explicitly covered in an informed consent protocol, including (Dudley, 2011):</p>

<ul>
  <li>The general purpose of the evaluation</li>
  <li>The evaluator’s qualifications and agency affiliation</li>
  <li>The expectations of the participant (e.g., number and length of interviews, location and time of interviews, types of questions)</li>
  <li>Assurance of confidentiality; when participants cannot be assured of confidentiality, participants must be told about how their identities will be revealed and to whom</li>
  <li>Identification of any potential negative effects of the evaluation on participants</li>
  <li>Identification of any potential benefits to participants resulting from their participation</li>
  <li>A reminder that participants can leave the study at any time without negative consequences, such as loss of client services (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02[i])</li>
  <li>A name and phone number of someone at the agency who can respond to participants’ questions or concerns</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>An Ethics Exercise</em></strong></p>

  <p>Assume that you work for a family services agency that provides a variety of services that assist families. In discussing your caseload with other social workers, you discover that many of your cases include children whose father is not present in their primary household. You want to conduct a needs assessment to find out whether the children have any contact with their father and how the absence affects them. You decide to ask the children several personal questions and want to consider any possible negative effects of the questions. Answer the following exercise questions:</p>

  <p>• What ethical issues are evident as you prepare for the study?
• How will you address these issues?
• What types of questions, if any, would you decide not to ask the children to protect them?
• Would you ask questions of children of all ages or just some age groups
• How would your questions be different depending on the child’s age?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also important to consider the ethical principles of the AEA (2018) for informed consent protocol. For example, while the purpose of the evaluation needs to be explained, a balance of information is recommended. Giving too much information about the evaluation could create a reactive effect in which the participants respond with what they perceive the evaluator wants to hear. Yet, giving too little information could be perceived as being deceptive and unethical.</p>

<p>Preferably, informed consent is provided to participants in written form. The advantages of written informed consent are important; for example, participants can easily review the forms, which make them easier to understand, and participants can keep a copy of the form for their records. Also, information provided by the evaluator in writing cannot be easily questioned at a later time, particularly if any legal issues arise. A participant’s signature on the informed consent form is clear evidence of consent. Most universities and social agencies require written consent for many of these reasons.</p>

<p>There are some limitations to written informed consent. For example, it is still possible that participants will misunderstand some aspects of the evaluation. Therefore, a written explanation of the study should be provided to participants and then discussed with them to make sure that they fully understand it. Such discussions are particularly helpful with people who have limited cognitive skills or distorted thinking processes because of mental retardation or mental illness. It is also important to fully inform involuntary clients, who may need to hear more than once that participation is voluntary.</p>

<p>Evaluation studies with questionnaires involve special circumstances. The informed consent information can be included in a cover letter or in the introductory paragraphs of the questionnaire. In this case, no one is usually available to answer any questions, so the informed consent must be fully self-explanatory. Participants usually are not asked to sign their names as a form of consent; this usually keeps the questionnaire anonymous. Instead, the evaluator assumes that participants who voluntarily fill out the questionnaire and return it accept the informed consent provisions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Steps to Follow in Constructing and Using an Informed Consent Form</em></strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Check to see what your agency requires to protect evaluation participants.</li>
    <li>Find out whether the agency has an IRB to approve studies; if not, propose that an ad hoc IRB be set up for this purpose.</li>
    <li>Consider all the following information in your efforts to inform the participants about the study:
      <ul>
        <li>Purpose of the study;</li>
        <li>How the results will be used;</li>
        <li>What will be expected of the participant;</li>
        <li>Your affiliation with a social agency;</li>
        <li>Any possible harmful effects from participating in the study;</li>
        <li>Possible benefits of participation;</li>
        <li>Confidentiality;</li>
        <li>Optional participation and ability to withdraw at any time; and</li>
        <li>Contact information for someone who can answer questions and concerns</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Find out if there are any mechanisms in place to assist participants if they experience any harmful effects (e.g., dealing with difficult emotions).</li>
    <li>If children are participants, decide how you will inform and involve their parents. If other clients have guardians, decide how you will involve them as well.</li>
    <li>With all the information that you have collected so far, prepare a draft of the informed consent forms or statements.</li>
    <li>Get feedback from your IRB or ad hoc committee on the adequacy of the informed consent form.</li>
    <li>Decide how you will protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants during data collection and the presentation of findings.</li>
    <li>Describe your plans to store and protect the data, including informed consent forms. Also indicate when you will destroy the data if the agency has no further use for it.</li>
    <li>Seek agency approval of your study.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="16-address-the-needs-of-participants-who-are-incapable-of-giving-informed-consent"><strong>1.6 Address the Needs of Participants Who Are Incapable of Giving Informed Consent</strong></h3>

<p>In the special case of evaluations that involve children or clients with legal guardians, the parents or guardians must give informed consent in their place (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). Although this extra step may seem to be a complication or inconvenience, legal guardians must make the decision on participation. In addition, even though the children and other clients without their own guardianship are not legally responsible, they should be treated with equal respect and given a thorough explanation of the study and the option to not participate. An “assent form” with all the information about the study that is covered in the informed consent form should be prepared for the children and those with guardians to sign. Thus, two informed consent procedures are needed.</p>

<h3 id="17-protect-the-confidentiality-of-participants"><strong>1.7 Protect the Confidentiality of Participants</strong></h3>

<p>The NASW (2017) code mentions several ways to protect the confidentiality of the participants (Sections 5.02). As indicated earlier, participants’ confidentiality or anonymity should be protected, and participants should be informed of the specific measures taken to ensure confidentiality and when their responses will be destroyed. Exceptions to confidentiality should also be explained, such as if participants respond in a way that indicates that they or another person is at risk of harm.</p>

<p>Participants should be informed that their responses will not be associated in any way with their name or any other identifying information. Sometimes a funding agency, such as a state agency, may require identifying information be linked to the responses. In such instances, it is important to explain to participants why they will be identified and to whom they will be identified (e.g., specific groups or officials). Such an exception should be stated in the initial informed consent with an explanation of why it is required. At that time, participants should also be told that they can voluntarily withdraw from the evaluation without any penalties.</p>

<p>Finally, measures must be taken to ensure that the information that participants share in an evaluation will only be discussed for professional purposes and only with people professionally concerned with this information. Such results are not to be shared casually or as an outlet for casual conversation or entertainment.</p>

<h3 id="18-participants-access-to-support-services"><strong>1.8 Participants’ Access to Support Services</strong></h3>

<p>Evaluators also have a responsibility to protect participants by providing access to support services when negative effects of participation in the evaluation do occur (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). This is particularly important if participants are vulnerable in some way, or if their participation could result in any physical or psychological harm. Support services could be offered by the agency sponsoring the evaluation or by a referral agency that can provide treatment or other assistance.</p>

<p>In the example of the needs assessment of the children with absent fathers cited earlier, the social workers or counselors assigned to serve these children can be alerted to the sensitivity of the questions so that they can explore any troubling feelings that the children reveal (e.g., hurt, abandonment, guilt, anger). The social workers counseling the children could also take the initiative to ask the residential parent to fill out a questionnaire periodically to uncover any problems in adjustment. Once the study is over, the agency could even consider offering a program that recruits and works with older males as mentors or friends with whom the children can spend time.</p>

<h3 id="19-evaluations-and-evaluators-without-a-conflict-of-interest"><strong>1.9 Evaluations and Evaluators without a Conflict of Interest</strong></h3>

<p>Professionals chosen to conduct evaluations should be free of any conflicts of relationships (AEA, 2018; NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). They should avoid and be alert to dual relationships with study participants and other stakeholders. For example, evaluators should not oversee programs or client services in which they conduct an evaluation because of the possible role conflicts.</p>

<p>One way for the evaluator to avoid conflicts of interest is to hire qualified outside evaluators who have no stake in the study results. If agency-based evaluators, for example, obtain results that are negative or potentially damaging to the agency, they should not be pressured to minimize or ignore such results in their presentations.</p>

<p>Misrepresentation of the findings of a study and other actions that compromise the study’s integrity and the safety of the participants must also be addressed (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). Agency staff members who conduct evaluations may be inclined to manipulate findings, such as omitting certain results or falsifying findings that could be counterproductive to an agency and its programs. The hiring of qualified outside evaluators usually ensures that they have the autonomy and freedom to report all significant findings, similar in some ways to a journal’s peer-review panel of experienced professionals, which is a valuable safeguard in preventing the publication of misrepresented findings.</p>

<p><strong><em>Checklist of Questions to Consider in Hiring  an Outside Evaluator</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the evaluator have the skills to use the methodologies and techniques that may be required in the study?</li>
  <li>Does the evaluator have the skills to help articulate the appropriate focus for the study?</li>
  <li>Does the evaluator have the management skills to carry out the study?</li>
  <li>Will the evaluator maintain appropriate ethical standards?</li>
  <li>Will the evaluator be interested in and able to communicate results to desired stakeholders in such a way that they will be used and useful? (Fitzpatrick &amp; Sanders, 2011)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="110-use-of-technology-in-evaluations"><strong>1.10 Use of Technology in Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>If electronic technology is being considered for use in an evaluation involving participants, evaluators should first obtain informed consent from the participants (NASW, 2017, Section 5.02). Evaluators should begin this process by asking whether participants are able to use the technology. If not, reasonable alternatives should be developed that are easier for participants to use. Technology-assisted evaluations could include use of computers, mobile or landline telephones, tablets, video technology, or other electronic or digital technologies; further, it could include the use of various electronic or digital platforms, such as the Internet, online social media, chat rooms, text messaging, e-mail, and emerging digital applications.</p>

<p>With growth in the use of communication technology in general and in evaluations, evaluators need to be sensitive to the challenges that may arise for participants in using it. Such technology may be problematic to use in several areas such as maintenance of confidentiality, informed consent, professional boundaries, professional competence, record keeping, and other ethical considerations.</p>

<h2 id="2-diversity-and-social-justice"><strong>2. DIVERSITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE</strong></h2>

<p>The CSWE mandates that every BSW and MSW program prepare its students with understanding, respect, and methods to help people in the areas of diversity and social justice. This includes those experiencing social and economic injustice, populations that are at risk, and people whose human rights are violated. Because social workers typically work with a diverse population of clients that are often oppressed and at risk, this mandate is critical to meet the needs of people in a culturally competent way (CSWE, 2015). This means also being responsive to these issues when conducting program and practice evaluations.</p>

<h3 id="21-diversity-and-its-importance-to-evaluations"><strong>2.1 Diversity and Its Importance to Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>When we fully consider the term <em>diversity</em>, we are talking about an almost unlimited number of characteristics that distinguish people. The NASW (2017) Code of Ethics highlights several characteristics of diversity that are particularly important in preparing social workers with cultural competence and sensitivity to social diversity. “Social workers should obtain education about and seek to understand the nature of social diversity and oppression with respect to race, ethnicity, national origin, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, political belief, religion, immigration status, and mental or physical disability.” Although the code has helped narrow the list of characteristics of diversity considerably, the list is still rather long. We know that often these areas of diversity comprise minority groups or groups that are more vulnerable than others, such as people with extremely serious needs, hardships, and diseases and people experiencing various forms of oppression.</p>

<p>What does it mean to give special attention to diversity in evaluation? Fortunately, diversity has become a normative aspect of social work research in recent years. Evaluations conducted by social workers typically include participants who are women, people of color, and people of different social classes, sexual orientations, disabilities, and age. Also, theoretical perspectives in social work have expanded to include feminism and Afrocentrism and, to a lesser extent, perspectives emphasizing the cultural needs of Latinos, Asian Americans, and recent immigrant groups; gays and lesbians; disability groups; and others (e.g., Adams &amp; Blumenfeld, 2018). International issues are also becoming more important as we increasingly realize that we live in a global community and depend on a global economy. However, many of these exciting developments are in an early formative stage and need to be expanded.</p>

<p>Diversity issues are important to consider in evaluations during all stages: planning, implementation, and outcome. For example, some possible diversity issues to consider when conducting a needs assessment during the planning stage include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are the participants able to read?</li>
  <li>Are there any language barriers?</li>
  <li>Are face-to-face interviews conducted in a location that feels safe and is easily accessible for the interviewee?</li>
  <li>Will some important groups be inadvertently excluded in a phone interview study?</li>
  <li>Will some important groups be excluded if the study is conducted on the internet?</li>
  <li>Will any group have discomfort or difficulty participating in an interview study?</li>
  <li>Will some groups choose to be excluded if an observational approach is used?</li>
  <li>How will difficult-to-reach groups such as racial minorities, people with very low incomes, undocumented workers, and those who do not speak English be recruited and involved?</li>
</ul>

<p>A growing number of journals have sprung up that focus on issues of diversity and international issues. Many of their articles report on evaluations of some type. The journals include Affilia: The Journal of Women and Social Work; Ethnic and Racial Studies; Indian Journal of Social Work; Journal of Gay and Lesbian Social Services; Journal of Gerontological Social Work; Hispanic Journal of Behavioral Sciences; Human Services in the Rural Environment; Journal of Multicultural Social Work; International Social Work; Journal of Immigrant and Refugee Services;_ and <em>European Journal of Social Work</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example of Chinese Hospice Patients</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mak (2002) interviewed thirty- three Chinese patients in a hospice program to investigate how they perceived features of a “good death.” The qualitative study uncovered seven elements or themes that can be helpful to hospice interventions: being aware of dying, maintaining hope, being free from pain and suffering, experiencing personal control, maintaining connectedness to others, preparing to depart, and accepting the timing of one’s death. Acceptance of the timing of death was re-ported to be easier in four circumstances: if the person had completed his or her social roles (e.g., parenting), if the person had reached an old age, if the person had a religious faith to help facilitate a hope in a better life after death, and if the person  had experienced a meaningful life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the general diversity characteristics proposed by CSWE (e.g., race, ethnicity, social class, gender) are vitally important in conducting evaluations, additional types of diversity are also important within specific client groups (Dudley, 2011). For example, if an evaluator is investigating the impact of mental health, substance abuse, or developmental disabilities programs, some aspects of those clients’ diversity could be overlooked. Programs for people with developmental disabilities could have varying degrees of impact given the different levels of disability (mild, moderate, severe, and profound) or the different causal or etiological factors (e.g.,</p>

<p>Down’s syndrome, cerebral palsy, environmental factors). Evaluations of programs for people with mental illness should consider the wide range of diagnoses of mental illnesses as well as whether they are acute or chronic. Programs for people who have survived physical and psychological abuse can have varying impact given current family arrangements, who the perpetrators were, environmental circumstances, and a history of abuse in family members’ own family of origin. In summary, evaluations must consider the impact of programs with respect to the various characteristics of diversity that affect clients. Ultimately, it is up to the evaluator to be sensitive to and identify the various effects of interventions based on the clients’ diversity.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example of a Needs Assessment That Addresses Diversity  in Homelessness</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two social workers conducted a needs assessment of homeless people in St. Louis, Missouri, (North &amp; Smith, 1994) to investigate and document the varied ways that white and minority men and women were thought to experience homelessness. The sensitivity of the authors to diversity issues was commendable in that they broke down all their results by race and gender. Essentially, they compared the circumstances of four subgroups: nonwhite men, white men, nonwhite women, and white women. On the negative side, they grouped all people of color together under the category of “nonwhite” and neglected to differentiate among African-Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, Asians, and others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="22-importance-of-human-rights-and-social-economic-and-environmental-justice-to-evaluation"><strong>2.2 Importance of Human Rights and Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice to Evaluation</strong></h3>

<p>Another special mandate promulgated by the CSWE (2015) is that social work programs give special emphasis to issues of social, economic, and environmental justice. One section of the CSWE educational policy describes two objectives for graduates in fulfilling this mandate. Social workers are expected to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apply their understanding of social, economic, and environmental justice to advocates for human rights at the individual and system levels and</li>
  <li>Engage in practices that advance social, economic, and environmental justice.</li>
</ul>

<p>These mandates are important to address in program and practice evaluation activities as well as practice. According to the values and ethics of the profession, social workers are encouraged to develop knowledge that promote the welfare of all people and especially disadvantaged groups. In other words, evaluations can be an empowering process for social work clients. There are several ways to conduct program evaluations with a social justice dimension or emphasis. Some of the subsequent examples suggest that the entire focus of a program evaluation can be on a social justice issue, while others may include only a social justice component.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of job-training and employment programs for people with disabilities based on whether they gain improved employment in the competitive job market</li>
  <li>Documenting the ways that people with disabilities are discriminated against in hiring practices</li>
  <li>Evaluating programs for homeless people by investigating how the programs help them obtain improved jobs, jobs with longevity, and higher incomes that can sustain them</li>
  <li>Conducting a needs assessment of homeless people that documents the extent to which those who are employed cannot afford decent housing</li>
  <li>Eliciting the viewpoints of numerous client groups to explore the extent to which the programs they use perpetuate their problems with stigma. Such client groups could, for example, include people with AIDS, schizophrenia, gays or lesbians, teenage parents, or former inmates.</li>
  <li>Any evaluation that interviews difficult-to-reach clients rather than relies on more accessible secondary sources, such as a family member or someone in a social support network</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Thinking Outside the Box by a Practitioner</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A social worker, Sharon Galusky, naturally reveals her understanding of the connections between evaluation and social justice when she describes the various ways she evaluates her practice as a case manager helping people with developmental disabilities. First, she describes the regulations that Medicaid, the funding agency, requires that she address in her agency documentation to receive reimbursement for her services. She then explains that she has additional criteria that she feels compelled to use to evaluate the effectiveness of her work as a case manager. She knows that one of her major goals with her clients is to help them reach a higher quality of life, so she and her clients have devised additional individualized criteria for each client, such as helping one client find a higher- paying job while finding another a volunteer position in which he can offer advice about saving money while grocery shopping (Sharon Galusky, MSW social worker at Open Doors Inc., Charlotte, NC, personal communication, July 2007).</p>

<h3 id="23-strategies-for-incorporating-diversity-and-social-justice-into-evaluations"><strong>2.3 Strategies for Incorporating Diversity and Social Justice into Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>There are numerous specific ways to incorporate perspectives on diversity and promotion of social, economic, and environmental justice into evaluations. First, it is important to identify and invite involvement from a diverse group of stakeholders, including people who represent the clients that the agency serves. Second, several initiatives can be considered at each of the Seven Evaluation Steps.</p>

<p>During step 1 (identify a problem to be evaluated) and step 2 (identify and explore ways to involve stakeholders), several potential stakeholders from the client population, former clients, and the local community can be asked along with other stakeholders to offer their views about a program-related problem or concern that requires evaluation. Because they will likely not know the views of the agency administrators and staff members, they can benefit from an orientation to such information. In addition, their unique perspectives as clients and family members of clients can be explored with questions such as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What programs have you or your family members used?</li>
  <li>How would you describe the agency and its programs and services based on your experiences?</li>
  <li>What stands out to you as particularly helpful? What stands out as weak or problematic?</li>
</ul>

<p>Having discussions with some of these stakeholders in step 1 will be helpful in revealing who they are, their specific perspectives, how their views vary, and their skills and confidence in effectively communicating what they think. Among a group of such potential community stakeholders, a few can be selected to assist in an evaluation. One approach to working with stakeholders is to create an advisory committee or collaborative team of stakeholders, including clients and community members, to assist and support the evaluators in the subsequent steps of the evaluation. Another approach is to periodically consult various stakeholders on an individual basis at a time and place convenient to them.</p>

<p>Step 3 (determine the purpose of the evaluation) focuses the evaluation on a specific problem or concern. This step is a critical one for considering diversity and social justice issues. All stakeholder groups, particularly those representing the client population, can be encouraged to give input on the purpose of the evaluation and the social change that the evaluation could accomplish. Some of the questions that could be posed to the client stakeholders include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What interventions have been particularly useful to you and others that you know? Which ones have not helped?</li>
  <li>In your opinion, what seem to be the most important ingredients in an effective approach that helps clients like yourself?</li>
  <li>How have the interventions assisted you in reaching your personal goals over time?</li>
  <li>What would you like for the interventions to do differently to help bring positive change into your life?</li>
  <li>What difficulties have you or your family members experienced, if any, in receiving services from these programs and practice areas?</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 4 (plan the evaluation) can explore many design issues, such as which single system design to use, whom to interview, what questions to ask, and how large a sample should be. Both professional and lay stakeholders will need some training to</p>

<p>participate, in an informed way, in such decisions. Some of the design questions can have a diversity or social justice component, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have we considered all the important demographic characteristics for participants when selecting the sample?</li>
  <li>What are some of the ways to reach a former client when we do not have a forwarding address or phone number?</li>
  <li>How can we formulate specific questions to encourage accurate answers?</li>
  <li>How does a program intervention further social justice for clients?</li>
  <li>How does an intervention strengthen the clients’ rights and responsibilities?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Example of an Evaluation Exploring Diversity</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A multiethnic community evaluation (Dudley, 1986) investigated the interventions of a community organization located in a multiethnic community in a large city; the organization’s primary goal was to lessen interracial strife. Approximately one hundred Southeast Asian (Hmong and Cambodian) people had been relocated from their native countries to this neighborhood. The neighborhood was almost entirely made up of African Americans and Puerto Ricans before this relocation. The community organization implemented several programs over two years to ad-dress the multiethnic strife, including a series of cultural events in which each group shared its customs, food, arts, and leisure activities with the larger community. Two years later, seventeen of the Southeast Asian residents were interviewed to explore the impact of the events on their attitudes and intergroup exchanges. The respondents recalled somewhat accurately the events that they had attended, and fourteen admitted having learned something from the events. Five volunteered that the events improved their multiethnic understanding. When asked if they had developed any intergroup friendships, eleven of the seventeen indicated having made friends of a different nationality. Although most of these relationships were   rather limited, almost all were with African American or Puerto Rican neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Step 5 (implement the evaluation) involves carrying out the plans and procedures worked out in step 4. Community stakeholders can provide helpful assistance in contributing to this step if they are well informed. Stakeholders could be useful in carrying out many aspects of this step, such as by suggesting strategies to find and engage participants who are difficult to contact or interview, contacting community and civic organizations to help identify participants for the study, offering a site for data collection, and assisting in data collection.</p>

<p>Step 6 (prepare a written or oral report) is one of the most important steps in which to involve community stakeholders, as the findings are intended to inform them and help them take some constructive action. Report findings should be made available in formats accessible to all stakeholder groups. Client and community stakeholders are often overlooked when preparing an evaluation report. To overcome this omission, evaluators would be remiss if they did not prepare a report that was relevant to clients and made available to them in some form. Formats that may be most helpful to these stakeholders are fliers on a bulletin board, brief reports in agency and community newsletters, brief handouts, and informal presentations during client sessions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Use of Handouts in a Study of Latino People with Food Insecurity Problems</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A needs assessment was conducted in a low- income Latino neighborhood in North Carolina prior to setting up a program to help them increase their long- term food security needs. The study focused partially on their preferences for overcoming food insecurity. They were asked to select their top three preferences from seven possible service areas. These service areas were counseling, government food subsidy programs, employment and school assistance, improving community connections, accessing more nutritious food, help with buying food, and help with preparing meals. Their responses were summarized in a one- page handout given to them and others in the community to inform them of the results of the study. This handout was used to engage these participants in discussions about whether the findings reflected their preferences or not. This step was followed up later with individual and group discussions on how to help them overcome their food insecurity circumstances. This handout is presented in Chapter 11 as an example of a brief report that was given to a community group after they had participated in a   needs assessment. (Dudley &amp; Vasquez, 2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, step 7 (disseminate the results) is another critical step for community stakeholders because they typically know a lot about how and when to disseminate evaluation findings in a manner that is relevant and useful to constituents. Evaluation findings can be disseminated in numerous creative ways. For example, evaluation findings intended to inform people and elicit feedback include community forums, neighborhood meetings, church gatherings, and community fairs. Further, stakeholders could disseminate the results of an evaluation and obtain feedback on proposed next steps for an agency.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example of an Evaluation Focusing on Empowerment  Issues in Practice</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Linhorst, Hamilton, Young, and Eckert (2002) reviewed existing documents and conducted focus groups with clients and staff of a public psychiatric hospital to identify barriers to client empowerment. They attempted to identify the conditions necessary for empowerment to occur, especially in getting clients to participate in their own treatment planning. The results revealed several empowerment is-sues, including the need to prepare clients with decision- making skills, provide a range of treatment options, ensure enough time for client participation in the planning process, and promote staff attitudes that are respectful of clients’ ability   and potential to participate in treatment planning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, diversity and social justice concerns can be infused in all or most of the Seven Evaluation Steps. The suggestions that are provided in the chapter are flexible and apply to numerous types of evaluations. A main point of the discussion in this section has been to consider efforts to involve stakeholders most likely to be affected by the problem being addressed by the evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="3-summary"><strong>3. SUMMARY</strong></h2>

<p>Chapter 3 focuses on the ethics of evaluations and the ethical obligations of people who conduct evaluations. The ethics codes of three professional groups are explored. Two of these groups are social work associations and are the NASW and the CSWE. The third group is the AEA, an interdisciplinary professional organization comprised exclusively of evaluators. Among the issues that are explored are the importance of IRBs, protecting clients when they are participants in an evaluation, informed consent, confidentiality, diversity and its importance in evaluations, and the importance of human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice in evaluations. The section on diversity and social justice includes specific suggestions during each of the Seven Evaluation Steps for how to involve stakeholders who are representatives</p>

<h2 id="4-discussion-questions-and-assignments"><strong>4. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Arrange groups of three to five people to work on each of the following scenarios of ethical issues in evaluation.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><em>Scenario 1</em></strong><em>:</em> You have been assigned to conduct an assessment of the needs of older adults in a community surrounding your agency, a senior center. You want to know whether the older adults would use some of your center’s existing services and new services that you are considering, including exercise groups, conversation groups, lunch programs, and nutritional workshops. You plan to conduct a phone interview study and will call a representative sample of households in the community.</p>

<h3 id="41-questions"><strong>4.1 Questions</strong></h3>

<p>a. What will you say/do to provide informed consent? What will you do if someone does not want to respond to phone interviews or wants to know more about your legitimacy?</p>

<p>b. What will you do if the person who answers the phone only speaks Spanish or another non-English language?</p>

<p>c. If the person who answers the phone is not an older adult but the household has older adults living there, how will you proceed? For example, what if the older adult is hesitant to speak or the person answering the phone is determined to respond for her or him? What can you do to ensure that the older adult’s voice is heard?</p>

<p><strong><em>Scenario 2</em></strong><em>:</em> You are a supervisor and you want to evaluate the impact of counseling groups on the client participants. You want a noninvolved social worker to observe the group, but you are concerned that this evaluation could disrupt the group leader or inhibit participation of group members.</p>

<h3 id="42-questions"><strong>4.2 Questions</strong></h3>

<p>a. What ethical issues may need to be considered in this observational study? How would you address them?</p>

<p>b. What will you say or do with the group leader and group members to obtain informed consent?</p>

<p>c. How can you minimize disruptions in the group process during the observation?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A social worker informs you that she is providing a unique sexual counseling program to several clients with cognitive challenges. No one else in her agency or any other agency that she knows about is offering such a program. In addition, her agency administrator is not asking her to evaluate her program. The administrator is just pleased that she is offering her services. This social worker consults you to ask what she should do. Should she continue providing her services without an evaluation plan? Or should she devise an evaluation? What specific suggestions would you give her for conducting an evaluation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume that you conducted a study three months ago in which you asked a group of clients to complete a questionnaire that measured their progress in improving communication skills since they had first received services from the agency. They were told that the findings would be kept strictly confidential and their names would not be included with any responses. However, now the agency wants to use the findings to evaluate the individual progress of each client. You have the original data and information on who filled out each questionnaire. What ethical issues are involved in this situation? What should you do?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are two advantages and two disadvantages of using an outside evaluator (instead of a staff member) to conduct an evaluation in your agency? What are some criteria you might use to select an outside evaluator?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assume you are an evaluator who has been asked to assist in preparing pretest and posttest instruments for an evaluation of a premarital workshop for couples. The evaluation is intended to measure the extent to which the participants improved in their communication with each other in several areas, including their sexual needs. You are asked to come to a board meeting to explain what the evaluation is all about. During the board meeting, an officer of the board states that he would like to add a “newly effective method of natural birth control” as a topic to add to the premarital workshops. He points out that he knows of a study that found that the divorce rate was significantly lower for a group of couples practicing this new form of natural birth control. He doesn’t give the board members a specific reference for this study. Up to this point, no material had been offered in previous workshops on specific forms of birth control or family planning. As the evaluator you are concerned that this seems like it may be an effort to emphasize one form of birth control over other forms based on the religious preference of this board member. As the evaluator, you are not a member of the board and do not attend board meetings on a regular basis. What would you do?</p>
  </li>
