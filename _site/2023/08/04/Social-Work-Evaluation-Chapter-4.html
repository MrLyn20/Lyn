<h1>Chapter 4 Common Types of Evaluations</h1>

<p class="view">by JAMES R. DUDLEY</p>

<h1 id="chapter-4-common-types-of-evaluations"><strong>CHAPTER 4: Common Types of Evaluations</strong></h1>

<p>What are some of the common ways in which evaluations are conducted in social agencies?</p>

<p>The discussion in Chapter.2 is about theoretical approaches to evaluations. This chapter gets into the practical applications. Anyone wanting to conduct an evaluation in today’s world has many options. One overall option, of course, is to decide whether you want to conduct a program or a practice evaluation, an important distinction. A further way to differentiate evaluations is to consider variations in methodology, especially whether you wish to use quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods (both quantitative and qualitative). There are many other ways to distinguish evaluations, and beginning evaluators are encouraged to become familiar with them.</p>

<p>The purpose of the chapter is to acquaint readers with most of the ways that evaluations are commonly conducted in social agencies. After reading this chapter, you should be able to identify them in your agency, attach names to them, and have a general understanding of their respective purposes. These evaluations are commonly practiced in social agencies, hospitals, health departments, schools, and residential and institutional programs across the country. Most of them are elaborated on in later chapters when the book discusses the implementation of evaluations. Let’s first look at common program evaluations followed by common practice evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="1-common-program-evaluations"><strong>1. COMMON PROGRAM EVALUATIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Common program evaluations presented in this chapter include needs 
assessments, program monitoring, client satisfaction studies, outcome studies, efficiency and cost– benefit analysis studies, licensing of programs serving clients, licensing of professionals, auditing and other accounting investigations, accreditation of social programs, quality assurance (QA) studies, court decisions, and newspaper and other media reports. Let’s look at each of them.</p>

<h3 id="11-needs-assessments"><strong>1.1 Needs Assessments</strong></h3>

<p>Needs assessments are a common evaluation that usually occurs in the planning stage prior to implementing a program. These assessments are used to deter-mine whether there is enough documentation of the need for a new or expanded program to justify it. Needs assessments often use questionnaires disseminated to the potential users of proposed programs. Other methods of data collection include informant interviewing, focus groups, public forums, and use of ex-isting data from such documents as the Current Population Surveys, conducted periodically by the U.S. Census. Needs assessments are more fully described in Chapter.6.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: Needs Assessment of Immigrants Living in Minneapolis</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two social workers (Muehlbauer &amp; Runnberg, 2006).conducted a basic needs assessment of immigrants and refugees who were students of English as a second language program in Duluth, Minnesota. They conducted face-to-face interviews with twenty-three students using both forced response and open-ended questions. The students were from several countries in Asia (China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam), Poland, Bosnia, Ecuador, Russia, Germany, and Somalia. Among the questions that the authors asked were the reasons they were living in the Duluth area, the amount of time they had spent in the United States and in Duluth, their employment status, and the extent to which they spoke English. They were also asked whether they had health and dental insurance. In addition, they were asked simple questions about their mental status (e.g. “Do you often feel sad or cry easily?”) and their worries, joys, and dreams. The results revealed a variety of needs, ranging from medical and dental care to qualitative comments about joys and worries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="12-program-monitoring"><strong>1.2 Program Monitoring</strong></h3>

<p>A wide variety of evaluations are used to monitor how an existing program is functioning. Program monitoring evaluations are also referred to as evaluations of program processes. They may be initiated voluntarily by an agency sponsoring the program or required by funding or regulatory agencies. These evaluations ask such questions as the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the program reaching its intended target population?</li>
  <li>Is the program being implemented as it was proposed?</li>
  <li>Do current staff members reflect expectations of equal employment and affirmative action policies?</li>
  <li>How do employees spend their time on the job?</li>
  <li>Are clients satisfied with the program?</li>
  <li>Are agency facilities safe and accessible (e.g., are elevators to upper floors available for clients in wheelchairs)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Program monitoring typically uses many different types of data-collection strategies, such as questionnaires given out to clients or staff members, individual and group interviewing of staff and clients, observations of programs and specific interactions between staff members and clients, reviews of existing documents such as client files and personnel documents, and consulting experts.</p>

<h3 id="13-client-satisfaction-studies"><strong>1.3 Client Satisfaction Studies</strong></h3>

<p>Client satisfaction studies are especially important when evaluating the implemen-tation of an intervention. The purpose of client satisfaction studies is to find out how the clients are feeling about and perceiving the services that they are receiving. These evaluations usually elicit the views of a fairly large number of clients, perhaps all those receiving the services of a program or all who have completed a program. These studies use either questionnaires or interview strategies to ask clients a series of questions about the various dimensions of a program.</p>

<p>The results of client satisfaction studies can provide helpful insights and other useful ideas about improving a program or clearing up clients’ misperceptions of programs. Afterward, the results also offer numerous opportunities for service providers to engage in informal conversations with clients on topics for which they may have unclear views. Such conversations can be conducted without violating confidentiality if they are simply introduced as general topics deriving from the responses to client satisfaction evaluations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: How Much Do Clients and Staff Agree  About the Clients’ Satisfaction?</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A client satisfaction interview was conducted with adults having a dual diagnosis of mental illness and mental retardation. Twenty-one forced-response questions were asked, such as “Do you like living here?” “Do staff listen to you or ignore you?” and “Do the staff treat you like a child or an adult?” (Dudley, 2002). The same questions were also asked of the staff member who knew each client best, but staff were asked to guess the clients’ answers to each question. The results re-vealed agreement 60.percent or more of the time on seventeen of the twenty-one questions. However, there were some serious discrepancies, such as a question on whether the clients wanted to continue to live at their current residence; consid-erably more clients said they wanted to leave than their staff member guessed. Another important discrepancy emerged when the clients were asked whether they felt afraid rather than safe where they lived; in this case, considerably more clients felt afraid than their staff member guessed. Both discrepancies suggest a need for staff members to become more familiar with their clients and their needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The clients’ responses to satisfaction questions are undoubtedly subjective and may be biased because of their status as recipients of services. Clients may not be able to be objective about those providing services to them, or they could easily blame providers for problems that could be more their own. Even with confiden-tiality promised by the evaluator, clients may also report being more positive about services than they actually feel. This can happen for numerous reasons, such as a fear of jeopardizing their client status or desire for the approval of staff members. The accuracy of their responses also depends on whether they have as much knowledge and understanding about what is being asked as the interviewer does. Other possi-bilities for error include that they may have inadequate recall of the time frame of the questions if they are too far in the past.</p>

<h3 id="14-outcome-evaluations"><strong>1.4 Outcome Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>Outcome evaluations are conducted to determine whether the recipients of a program are reaching the goals set for them when they began the program. These outcomes can take many forms and are typically socially desirable goals intended to help them. Outcome evaluations mostly use quasi-experimental and experimental group designs to control for, to varying degrees, other factors that could influence clients’ progress on their goals. A program can usually take no more than partial responsibility for any progress that clients make.Chapter.9 is largely devoted to out-come evaluations and the various types of quasi-experimental and experimental research designs available for outcome evaluations. The results-oriented model described in Chapter 2 is a theoretical version of outcome evaluations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: Do Financial Literacy Classes Help People Living  in Low-Income Communities?</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although programs designed to increase financial literacy are widely promoted, there is little evidence of their impact on financial knowledge or behavior. This study used an experimental design to examine the effectiveness of a financial literacy course taken by low-income individuals living in a nonprofit residential program (Reich &amp; Berman, 2015). Participants were randomly assigned either to a 4-week financial literacy course (n =.17) or a wait-list control group (n =.16). They completed baseline measures prior to taking the course to assess their financial knowledge (e.g., which loan payments should take priority), negative behaviors (e.g., overdrawing a financial account), and positive behaviors (e.g., leaving money in a savings account). After completing the course, they completed outcome measures of the same variables. Overall, results of this experiment confirmed that the financial literacy course increased both their financial knowledge and positive financial behaviors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="15-efficiency-and-costbenefit-analysis-studies"><strong>1.5 Efficiency and Cost–Benefit Analysis Studies</strong></h3>

<p>Efficiency evaluations are conducted to find out whether the resources allocated to a program are being used as efficiently as possible. These studies examine the ratio of inputs to outputs and measure the amount of a specific output (e.g., number of clients served <strong><em>input</em></strong>, number of clients completing a program <strong><em>output</em></strong> against the costs). In this type of study, the higher the number of clients served at a fixed cost, the better. These studies usually want to get the maximum amount of output for the money spent to help clients. A major limitation of efficiency studies is that they do not assume that program goals are being fully accomplished. Evaluating outcomes is not usually part of their purpose, only outputs.</p>

<p>In contrast, cost–benefit analysis studies are designed to determine whether programs are reaching their goals in a cost-effective way. In other words, are the incurred costs reasonable? Cost–benefit studies look at the ratio of inputs to outcomes. These studies typically aim to find out how much a program costs and whether the program is less costly than another program that has been found to be equally effective. Often cost–benefit analyses are conducted by comparing two or more programs using, for example, different approaches or different combinations of staff members and other resources. The program that meets its goals with the least amount of cost is usually the most desirable one. Examples of important questions asked in cost-benefit studies that compare one program to another are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the per capita cost of an institutional program more or less than a com-munity program for people with mental illness or developmental disabilities?</li>
  <li>Are outpatient community rehabilitation programs for offenders serving time for victimless crimes less expensive per capita than similar programs for such offenders residing in federal prison?</li>
  <li>Are the public health costs of preventing cigarette smoking among teenagers more cost-effective than the public health care cost of treating cigarette smokers for lung cancer?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="16-licensing-of-programs"><strong>1.6 Licensing of Programs</strong></h3>

<p>Licensing of the programs serving clients is another important purpose of evaluations. Licensing is usually concerned with basic health and safety standards and related concerns. Licensing is particularly relevant for residential programs, such as group homes for adolescents, people with developmental disabilities, or older adults. Licensing is also likely to be required for healthcare agencies and agencies that provide meals to clients. Licensing inspections and renewals may occur annually or more often, and they may be conducted to detect unsanitary conditions in food preparation, the adequacy of safety in bathrooms, and safety in use of floors and stairs. Licensing activities are also conducted to find out whether there are such things as fire doors, sprinkler systems, alarms, extinguishers, and adequate fire exits.</p>

<p>Either local or state governmental agencies usually assume responsibility for licensing programs, and the policies defining the parameters of licensing regulations are usually enacted as laws passed by legislative bodies and further developed into regulations by licensing agencies. Usually, licensing evaluations require that only minimal, not optimum, standards be met. Licensing sometimes functions as an external influence that may encourage agencies to pursue additional evaluation activities of their own.</p>

<h3 id="17-licensing-of-professionals"><strong>1.7 Licensing of Professionals</strong></h3>

<p>Licensing of professionals in social work and other helping professions is another important type of evaluation. This type of licensing is becoming increasingly evident as human services become more complex and professionalized and as expectations about client outcomes are raised to higher levels. Licensing laws exist to protect the use of a professional title, like clinical social worker, psychologist, family therapist, or marriage counselor so that the public can be assured that qualified people provide them with these services.</p>

<p>State governments license professional titles, including the titles of professional social workers. Many states use the acronym LCSW, which stands for Licensed Clinical Social Worker, as a standard social work title. Other titles are also often used and are viewed more as certifications than licenses. These certificates are not usually required titles for hiring; nevertheless, they provide a status that can distinguish the holder from those with fewer or different credentials. Examples of certification titles include Certified Bachelor of Social Worker, Certified Master of Social Worker, and Certified Social Work Manager. Although state licensing of social workers is a some-what recent development, primarily having occurred in the past three decades, all fifty states now have some form of professional licensing for social workers.</p>

<p>To be professionally licensed, a person is usually required to have an advanced degree in the professional area of licensing. Other requirements usually include additional professional employment, such as two years of post degree practice under the supervision of a licensed supervisor and passage of an exam on the knowledge and skill areas of the profession.</p>

<h3 id="18-auditing-and-other-accounting-investigations"><strong>1.8 Auditing and Other Accounting Investigations</strong></h3>

<p>Auditing of an agency’s financial affairs and other accounting measures are another form of program evaluation. In this case, the evaluation involves an independent review of the financial policies, procedures, and records of an agency to make sure that they are accurate and meet existing legal codes and procedures. Auditing is important to ensure that tax codes are followed and to detect and prevent misuse of funds by agency personnel and others. Trained accountants and tax experts who represent private firms independent of the agency being audited usually conduct audits. Audits are carried out by accountants who have very different training than social workers. Nevertheless, social workers in administrative positions should know the basics of auditing and other accounting procedures, their varied purposes, and the appropriate procedures to follow in hiring qualified auditors and overseeing their work.</p>

<h3 id="19-accreditation-of-social-and-educational-programs"><strong>1.9 Accreditation of Social and Educational Programs</strong></h3>

<p>Program accreditation is another common evaluation. Agencies that accredit programs are concerned with programs meeting specific standards more than the qualifications of individual professionals. Accreditation is a form of quality control that program sponsors recognize and seek out to ensure that a program meets pro-fessional standards. Because the standards of a professional accrediting organization and the policies of their member agencies are likely to differ, it is almost inevitable that the accrediting body and the agencies being accredited experience some ten-sion and possible conflict over priorities. For example, while the member agencies are likely to base many priorities on their access to funding and the demands of their board members, accreditation groups may stress value-oriented areas, such as promoting client dignity and greater client independence. Accreditation groups are likely to expect programs to maintain relatively low ratios between the number of direct-care staff members and the number of recipients of services, while a member agency may feel less compelled to follow such ratios, particularly if it has a shortage of funds or wants more independence to freely transfer resources from one program to another. As an example, CSWE, the social work education accreditation agency, expects MSW programs to have a minimum of six full-time faculty members while a university sponsor may want to assign less full-time faculty to a program and per-haps use some part-time faculty instead.</p>

<p>What makes accreditation of social and educational programs so unusual is that it is run by nonprofit professional organizations rather than governmental agencies. Accrediting agencies essentially propagate specific professional standards or requirements that university and agency members are expected to follow. At times, member agencies may perceive that the accreditation standards interfere with their internal decision making; they may also complain about the relatively high fees required for accreditation. Yet accreditation processes are a remarkable example of a decades-long cooperative partnership among professionally sponsored accredit-ation agencies, accredited member agencies, and governmental agencies that allow an independent group to enforce professional standards. Accreditation organiza-tions are very familiar to most agencies that employ social workers. Table 4.1 lists some of the most likely accrediting organizations that social workers will work with.</p>

<p>Accreditation is usually a voluntary process, but programs are strongly per-suaded to obtain it for status and program legitimacy. Social work accreditation, for example, is essential for both BSW and MSW degree programs that expect to gain support from their university sponsor and to succeed in admitting a critical mass of students to their programs. Furthermore, if graduates of a nonaccredited program look for jobs as professional social workers, it is unlikely that employers will hire them. The benefits of graduating from an accredited program include eligibility to apply for a state social work license, ability to receive third-party payments from various funding agencies such as Medicaid as reimbursement for work with clients, and ability to enjoy many of the benefits of membership in NASW and other professional social work associations.</p>

<h3 id="110-quality-assurance"><strong>1.10 Quality Assurance</strong></h3>

<p>QA is a rather distinct collection of evaluation activities implemented in many agencies to monitor how well their programs work. The quality of the program’s functioning is the primary intent of such evaluations. QA is also sometimes referred to as quality improvement or quality control. The QA activities are implemented to gather information about the processes of programs and to deter-mine whether they function the way they are supposed to. QA activities have their earliest origins in health care settings and are likely to be implemented most easily in these settings. However, with some minor modifications, QA activities are also relevant to evaluation of programs in other social welfare settings, such as child welfare and aging.</p>

<p>QA activities can be most easily distinguished from other program monitoring approaches by the specific methods and techniques that are used. These methods and techniques include peer-conducted reviews, heavy reliance on client records, observation of small samples of the services, ensuring that minimal standards are met, and immediate incorporation of useful results into program improvements. Each of these special characteristics are elaborated on next.</p>

<h4 id="1101-peer-reviews"><strong>1.10.1 Peer Reviews</strong></h4>

<p>First, the methods of QA involve peer reviews rather than the more typical administrative reviews. A.QA approach empowers staff members to conduct their own evaluations instead of relying on administrators to conduct the reviews. Peer review teams usually include representatives of the different specializations and discip-lines of the agency’s staff. It should be noted that peer assessments will likely have a natural tendency to be biased in favor of the staff members’ attitudes, needs, and practices over administrative perspectives. To bring some balance to this ten-dency and to maintain as much objectivity as possible, peer-review teams often use special methods, such as representation from all staff groups and reports to administrative staff.</p>

<p>Many administrators prefer QA activities because they are delegated to the staff members involved most directly in a program. Many administrators like this ap-proach because it places staff members in charge of evaluating their own programs, which can instill in them a mindset of self-evaluation. Also, delegation of QA activ-ities can free up administrative time and energy for other important matters. From an ethical perspective, QA promotes the social work value of self-determination, as it empowers staff members to continually evaluate themselves and how they can improve.</p>

<h4 id="1102-use-of-client-records"><strong>1.10.2 Use of Client Records</strong></h4>

<p>The QA approach typically relies on appraisals of staff revealed in client records rather than direct observation of services. Such a data source makes it much easier to conduct a review in a short period of time because records already exist and are easily accessible, whereas direct observations take considerably more time and could inconvenience or interfere with the delivery of services to clients. Also, a focus on record-keeping reveals a secondary characteristic of QA; it monitors the quality of the record-keeping system, which in itself is an important means of accountability.</p>

<h4 id="1103-reviewing-small-samples-of-services"><strong>1.10.3 Reviewing Small Samples of Services</strong></h4>

<p>Another methodological aspect of a QA approach is that it serves only as a spot check on how the program is functioning. Typically, a small sample of program recipients is selected and sometimes a sampling of only a few components of a program. In contrast, many other program evaluation approaches tend to examine all components of a program and virtually the entire client population that they serve. QA typically uses random sampling to avoid selection bias, and the evaluators usually do not notify the direct service staff of when the evaluation will occur, and which clients will be involved until the evaluation happens. Theoretically, this approach ensures that virtually every client and component of service can be included in an evaluation, thereby precluding any attempt on the part of direct service staff to select specific records to review or to prevent the review of other records.</p>

<h4 id="1104-minimal-standards"><strong>1.10.4 Minimal Standards</strong></h4>

<p>Another characteristic of QA is its limited goal of meeting minimal standards. On the one hand, a staff review team could easily decide that it is not important to meet exceptionally high standards. Yet lower expectations from external sources could also give a QA team more freedom and flexibility to strive for higher standards on their own with the application of self-imposed standards. A disadvantage of emphasizing minimal standards is that a QA team may not be able to focus on the more dysfunctional aspects of a program.</p>

<h4 id="1105-immediately-implemented-results"><strong>1.10.5 Immediately Implemented Results</strong></h4>

<p>A final characteristic of QA is that if its findings suggest the need for program improvements, the changes can be implemented immediately. This benefit has obvious advantages over an approach that expects a study to be completed before any recommendations are considered for implementation. In the case of QA, an administrator can take immediate steps to correct a program component or add a new procedure when an omission is discovered in program operation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: Quality Assurance at Youth Homes</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Youth Homes is an agency that provides specialized foster care, residential group homes, and family-strengthening services for abused, neglected, and other at-risk children. The agency works closely with the local Department of Human Services and the Office of Justice. Youth Homes has a full-time staff member—an experienced social worker with an MSW degree, assigned to oversee its QA services. The staff member works with three staff committees to conduct reviews. The Clinical Care Committee meets every eight weeks to review a random sample of client cases. Also, they review another sample of high-risk cases to determine whether four types of documentation are evident in each case file and whether recommendations have been implemented. The Client Rights Committee, the second staff committee, meets quarterly and reviews client incident reports (e.g., accidents, administrative errors), client grievances, feedback from the suggestions box, results of client focus groups, and results of a client satisfaction survey (administered annually) to investigate whether the rights of the clients have been violated. The Staffing and Facilities Committee, the third staff committee, meets quarterly to review staff turnover reports, staff training reports, employee satisfaction survey results, annual staff exit interviews, and a variety of facility issues (e.g., new facility needs; assessment of vehicles; maintenance needs; fire, safety, health, and accident reports). The QA social worker convenes all three committees, reviews and coordinates the committees’ corrective action requests, and prepares evaluation reports quarterly and annually. The annual report is then incorporated into an annual plan that provides projected agency goals and plans for the next year (B. Lackey, Quality Improvement Coordinator with Youth Homes, Charlotte, NC, personal communication, January 2005).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="111-court-or-judicial-decisions"><strong>1.11 Court or Judicial Decisions</strong></h3>

<p>Judicial decisions are often an overlooked form of program evaluation as they are most likely to focus on policies, not programs. Our judicial system at the local, state, and federal levels is a form of checks and balances on the executive and legislative branches of government. Class action suits are pursued when all other attempts to seek justice for a group of people may have failed. A.class action suit brings together many people who have similar circumstances and conditions and have been treated unjustly according to an existing law. Such a lawsuit, if successful, can lead to the propagation of new or corrective policies that must be implemented as long as the suit is in existence. In this case, a special master and staff are set up to oversee implemen-tation of the lawsuit and report to the ruling judge. The judge temporarily removes from legal responsibility the governmental agency that has been found negligent and replaces it with the judge and a special master who oversees the implementation of court-mandated, corrective measures and monitors their implementation. Although the initial focus of a class action suit is on government policies, an evaluation often is implemented to determine whether new or modified programs address the needs and problems of the class of people who are the plaintiffs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: Class Action Suit involving People With a Dual Diagnosis</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An example is a lawsuit conducted in North Carolina for over ten years on behalf of more than 1,200 people with a dual diagnosis of mental illness and mental retardation. These class members had all been misplaced in state mental hospitals because there was no other reasonable alternative available (Dudley, Calhoun, &amp; Ahlgrim-Delzell, 2002). By admitting them to state hospitals for a decade or more, the federal district court order specified that the plaintiff class members had their constitutional rights violated in several basic areas, including safety, protection from harm, treatment under safe conditions, freedom from undue restraint, minimally adequate habilitation or treatment, and treatment necessary to remedy any injuries caused by the class members’ stay in the hospitals. A.longitudinal evaluation was established to monitor how the implementation of the court order affected the class members, and it primarily focused on the effectiveness of existing and new programs implemented to remedy the violations incurred. Interviews were conducted with all the class members annually for eight years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="112-newspaper-and-other-media-reports"><strong>1.12 Newspaper and Other Media Reports</strong></h3>

<p>Television, newspaper journalistic accounts, and Internet news websites are likely to focus on the inadequate and sometimes scandalous conditions of social programs that purport to serve a neglected group of people. Reporters’ accounts may not be considered evaluation per se, but they are typically investigations that are thorough, are based on the specific conditions of the people who are investigated and pro-vide valuable information to the public and those who are expected to protect them. Sometimes these reports are case studies that vividly portray one person’s conditions. This is illustrated in the following box titled “Could the State Have Saved Lynnette?”</p>

<p>Newspaper and television series have covered numerous stories of massive program dysfunction and have often provided the first report that educates the public on such outrages. One could say that these reports are one-sided, in favor of the people who are alleged to be exploited, but they seem to be objective in reporting what happens in local communities throughout the country. They can be viewed as program evaluations in the broadest sense of the word, and they are an important community tool for exposing many inadequate policies and programs existing in human services. They have been instrumental in exposing such problems as inadequate housing, the hiring of untrained workers, misuse of medications, inadequate staff supervision, safety concerns, racial and gender discrimination, clients’ exposure to inappropriate hardships and harm, sexual exploitation, and the overlooking of groups of people who need access to a program’s services.</p>

<p><strong><em>Example: A newspaper article “Could the State  Have Saved Lynnette?”</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another patient dies in mental health care……..The girl in the hospital bed looked nothing like Lynnette. Purple bruises covered her face, arms, chest, and legs. Her mouth was swollen. Blood dripped from her nose. She had a rug burn on her shoulder. She was unconscious, and a ventilator helped her breathe. Donald M..(the father) threw himself across her bed and cried. Ellen M..(the mother) whispered, “Mommy’s here. Mommy’s here.” Twenty-four-year-old Lynnette M., who was mentally ill and mildly retarded, had suffered a head injury about eight hours earlier in X County home operated by a company called YZ. Police believe she and her caregiver may have struggled, and Lynnette hit her head on the floor. Her caregiver waited about seven hours before calling an ambulance, police say. On December 19, Lynnette died after seven weeks in a coma. She is one of the most recent mental health patients to die under questionable circumstances while in the care of group homes, psychiatric hospitals, and other mental health facilities. The Ms and a growing group of supporters are launching a push to change North Carolina’s mental health laws, particularly for a group of 2,500 of the state’s most vulnerable patients. They are adults like Lynnette, known as Thomas S. clients, who have both mental retardation and mental illness. (Cenziper, 2000)</p>

<h2 id="2-common-practice-evaluations"><strong>2. COMMON PRACTICE EVALUATIONS</strong></h2>

<p>Just as there are common or well-known ways of evaluating programs,
there are also common ways of evaluating professional practice that are popular across agency settings. They fall under at least four broad categories:.(a) assessing client needs, (b).monitoring the quality of practice, (c).client satisfaction, and (d).client outcomes.</p>

<h3 id="21-assessing-clients-needs"><strong>2.1 Assessing Clients’ Needs</strong></h3>

<p>Based on the problem-solving approach, an assessment of the clients’ problems logic-ally precedes the taking of any steps to help them. Assessing clients’ problems and related circumstances is a common practice that is needed to determine what the next steps should be, that is, the interventions that will hopefully help them. Familiar assessment tools include family genograms, ecomaps, a variety of biopsychosocial assessment tools, and assessments of client strengths and weaknesses. Family genograms provide a visual display of a family across two or more generations and offer insights into understanding the patterns and dynamics evident in fam-ilies. Ecomaps are a visual tool that identifies the person-in-environment constellation of a client, including relationships with friends and family members, agencies and schools, jobs, and other social supports. Biopsychosocial assessment tools are available in most agencies and identify questions and topics to explore in several areas of a client’s life, especially the biological, psychological, and social. In addition, these tools include assessment questions about the spiritual, mental, and cultural aspects of a client. Assessments of client strengths and weaknesses, especially assessment questions about a client’s strengths, are an area that is often overlooked in assessments. Cowger, Anderson, and Snively (2006), for example, have constructed an elaborate qualitative assessment tool of client strengths for use with clients.</p>

<h3 id="22-monitoring-practice"><strong>2.2 Monitoring Practice</strong></h3>

<p>Social work practitioners often use various means to monitor their practice. In many cases, these monitoring efforts may not even be thought of as evaluations even though they are. Practice is monitored in several different ways including using process recordings, direct observations, case summaries and client journals, and case management.</p>

<h3 id="23-process-recordings"><strong>2.3 Process Recordings</strong></h3>

<p>Process recordings are one well-known evaluation of practice. Supervisors and practice teachers often ask new practitioners or students to complete a process recording of a sampling of their interactions with their clients. These recordings are then care-fully reviewed in a supervisory session to explore how the social worker responded to the client’s comments and conducted the session overall. Often these recordings help reveal missed opportunities to respond to a subtle message of the client that a worker may have ignored or misread. In these instances, the supervisor can help the worker explore how to address such client behaviors differently in future interviews. Such supervisory discussions have been known to help new workers consider alter-native responses and to be more disciplined in hearing the underlying messages of clients in future interviews.</p>

<h3 id="24-direct-observations"><strong>2.4 Direct Observations</strong></h3>

<p>Direct observations of practice through a two-way mirror or videotaping have helped supervisors and workers critique their practice to make improvements. Also, audiotaped interviews should not be overlooked, as much can be learned from listening to how one sounds and about what one says in an interview.</p>

<h3 id="25-case-summaries-and-client-journals"><strong>2.5 Case Summaries and Client Journals</strong></h3>

<p>Other devices such as case summaries by the worker and personal journals of clients have been known to help monitor practice. A case summary of one individual, a group or a summary of work with a client over a period of time along with questions and plans for future interviews can be very helpful to review. Having clients keep a journal of some aspect of their behavior that they wish to change (e.g., desire to use alcohol, or partaking in negative self-talk) and discussing the results with their social worker is another form of monitoring practice.</p>

<h3 id="26-case-management"><strong>2.6 Case Management</strong></h3>

<p>Case management is a formal employment title often held by a social worker (e.g., Frankel &amp; Gelman, 2011). In this position, the employee often monitors the individual practice of other human service workers and the programs that are provided to a client to whom they are assigned. Case managers typically find services for their clients, negotiate or facilitate contracts with the agencies offering services, monitor them to ensure that they deliver the contracted services, and advocate when necessary on behalf of clients. Case managers continually monitor the range of services that are provided to their clients to ensure their quality and continued appropriateness.</p>

<h3 id="27-client-satisfaction"><strong>2.7 Client Satisfaction</strong></h3>

<p>Client satisfaction evaluations are not only important to introduce in monitoring programs but also in monitoring practice interventions. Client satisfaction is typic-ally conducted at the time when a client is terminating services. However, inquiring about client satisfaction while services are still being provided leaves open the possi-bility that adjustments can be made in the practice interventions while they are still being provided to clients. It is wise for social workers to periodically hold informal client satisfaction discussions with their clients. The workers can ask clients whether they are satisfied with the services that they are receiving. When clients are not fully satisfied, they can be engaged in discussions about how the services could be pro-vided differently or in a more helpful way. Also, such inquiries often help empower the client and can increase the bond between a worker and client. Typical client sat-isfaction questions that can periodically be asked of a client include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What do you like about what I.am doing to help you?</li>
  <li>What am I.doing that is helpful to you? How is it helpful?</li>
  <li>What would you like for me to do that I.am not doing that could be helpful?</li>
  <li>What am I doing that is not helpful to you?</li>
  <li>How am I helping you reach your goals?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="28-client-outcomes"><strong>2.8 Client Outcomes</strong></h3>

<p>Practitioners are expected to adequately document that their interventions are effective in improving outcomes for clients or put another way succeeding in helping clients meet their goals. Basic questions about outcomes that all practitioners need to frequently ask themselves are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are my interventions helping clients reach their goals?</li>
  <li>Are my interventions responsible for bringing about positive or constructive changes in my clients’ lives?</li>
  <li>How are my interventions helping?</li>
  <li>In what ways could my interventions be more effective in helping my clients reach their goals?</li>
</ul>

<p>Several evaluation tools are available to help practitioners evaluate whether their clients are reaching their goals. These tools include single-system designs, which plot the changes that a client makes over time and observes whether the interventions are responsible for these changes when they occur. Single-system designs focus on the impact of the interventions of one social worker on a client system. A goal attainment scale is another helpful tool that can be used to evaluate the extent to which the worker’s interventions affect the clients’ goals in a favorable way. The goal attainment scale is an incremental scale that can be used to measure the degree of progress. A target problem scale is another outcome scale that can be used particularly when client goals are difficult to identify. A target problem scale is helpful if clients remain focused on their problems and are not prepared to identify goals that can overcome their problems. More detailed information is provided on all these evaluation tools in Chapter.9.</p>

<h3 id="29-summary-of-practice-evaluations"><strong>2.9 Summary of Practice Evaluations</strong></h3>

<p>Table 4.3 summarizes the previous discussion about the common ways that practice evaluations can be conducted in social agencies. The table also illustrates some of the purposes of questions that could be asked for each practice evaluation and examples of actual questions.</p>

<h2 id="3-common-evaluations-and-the-three-stage-approach"><strong>3. COMMON EVALUATIONS AND THE THREE-STAGE APPROACH</strong></h2>

<p>The three-stage approach introduced in the first two chapters is an important frame-work for understanding when these different types of evaluations are important to use. Using this framework, each of these evaluations described in the chapter can be further classified as to whether they focus on the planning, implementation, or outcome stage. Among the list covered, needs assessments used for programs and practice interventions are relevant to the planning stage. Can you identify the types of evaluations in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 that are process evaluations occurring during the implementation stage? Which ones are used during the outcome stage?</p>

<h2 id="4-summary"><strong>4. SUMMARY</strong></h2>

<p>The chapter introduces you to most of the common evaluations that are used in social agencies, hospitals, residential programs, and schools. Most of them are used to evaluate programs while a smaller number are available for conducting practice evaluations. Hopefully, this introduction will help you to be able to identify the types of evaluations that are conducted in the places where you are or will be employed. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 provide helpful summaries of all these evaluations. For each of them, the kinds of questions that are asked and an example of an evaluation question are included. Now that you have a grasp of several commonly used evaluations and how they can be classified using the three-stage approach, we turn to the next section on how to focus an evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="5-discussion-questions-and-assignments"><strong>5. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select a program or practice evaluation of interest to you from the lists of those described in the chapter that depends on research methods (e.g., survey questions, outcome measures, quasi-experimental designs). Then find out whether this actual evaluation was or is used at your agency or at another agency with which you are familiar. If such an evaluation cannot be found, look for an example of this type of evaluation in a professional journal. In either case, carefully review the evaluation, look closely at how it was conducted, and share what you learned with your class.</li>
  <li>Several other types of evaluations covered in the chapter tend to emphasize research methods less and are also described in this chapter. They include QA studies, licensing, newspaper reports, and court decisions. Find out if your agency has conducted or participated in any of these types of evaluations in the past or present. If such an evaluation cannot be found, look for an example of this type of evaluation in a professional journal. In either case, find out what they learned and how the results were used to improve a program or practice intervention. Share what you learned with your class.</li>
  <li>Select one of the accreditation agencies listed in Table 4.1. Visit the agency’s website and find out what specific kinds of agencies are members. Also identify two standards that this accreditation organization requires of member agencies. List one compelling reason to require these standards and one reason why some member agencies may find it difficult to implement these standards.</li>
</ol>
